Author: Myk Taylor (myk002)
Status: unorganized notes


See component_diagram_model.* for a visual representation of the following
design.


  Version all persistent state so upgrades can be handled seamlessly
  3c - use programmatic API to 7z/rar/zip libraries to extract individual files
-- this will make auto-annealing much more efficient
  5a,b,c - integration with external merge tools, save original ini in cache in
case orig is deleted before upgrade

I toyed with the idea of using installer/directory modification dates to "store"
priority order, but I think there are too many situations that can lead to
unexpected behavior, like the user archiving the installation, redeploying on
another computer, and suddenly losing the priority order due to the archiving
tool not recording the original dates (like zip). I also considered naming the
files with their priorities, but I was concerned that this would hinder users
that download updates from tesnexus and like to just drop them in the Bash
Installers folder and overwrite the old file.
Instead, I had some other ideas that would hopefully make the install order
database much more difficult to lose:
- State saved in smaller "packages". e.g. state for each project is stored in a
separate file, and overall install order is stored in its own file. If one file
is corrupted/lost most state is still salvageable
- On-disk state is versioned, allowing for smooth transition when an upgrade
changes the file formats
- Each session (program execution) saves in a different slot. state from the
previous N executions are kept in case most current state is corrupt
(transparent fallback)
- Automatic state saves in the current slot every 2 mins or so
- UI elements: force save state, revert to previous state slot

- About loading priority
be careful about second-guessing too much the user. Meaning that I'd rather have
a "reload THIS package now you stupid program" button than a 'smart' algorithm
which doesn't work.
[/quote]
The algorithm I had in mind was fairly simple. All projects get some worker
thread attention to avoid starvation, but the most recently clicked-on project
gets the greatest priority. We'll have to see how this works in practice, but it
is intended to fill the currently-shown details pane ASAP.

- What happens if you drop a package in the Bash Installers dir, and BAIT
discovers that every one of its files are already fully installed?...I imagine
you want to keep the "install status", since if some files from installed
packages get deleted in the Data folder (by OBMM for instance), the next
annealing should reinstall them....In the case of a completely lost BAIT
database, provided you more or less remember which packages you had installed,
you'd just have to select those, "copy installed status from sync status", and
you'd almost be back in business.
Also in the same spirit when selecting a file in the Data tree that doesn't come
from any installed mods, but that several mods could install, you could list
"potential owners".
[/quote]
Each project/file will have a checkbox next to it to control the
"isMarkedForInstall" flag. Additionally, files that match the installed version
will be highlighted in green, regardless of whether they are marked for install.
Files that are marked for install, are conflict winners, but do not match what
is installed will be highlighted in orange (like the current projects that need
annealing). Files that are newly deselected and would result in the file being
deleted from the data directory would also be highlighted as "needs annealing".
Analysis could certainly be performed on the installed data to reconstruct a
lost database. In fact, that would be a great way to initialize the database on
first use when transitioning from the old tab! As long as a user hasn't manually
resolved any circular conflicts, it shouldn't be too hard to automate.

- I imagine you'll display the tree of unrecognized packages to allow examining
and opening files, but grey out their whole tree and prevent installation?
[/quote]
that's the idea : ) each file/directory will have a flag: "isCruft" that will
affect whether it is grayed our or not in the UI. Unrecognized structures will
have everything marked as isCruft.



Model Internals
---------------
-- Model Thread Model --
The model performs all the disk IO, and is therefore highly multithreaded to
avoid getting stuck on Python's blocking read and write operations.  A worker
pool dequeues tasks and executes them, acquiring locks and updating the node
metadata database as necessary.  Asynchronous tasks from API calls are handled
at a higher priority than background loading or anaysis tasks.  Synchronous API
calls (the get_ methods) are handled in the calling thread.  Whenever a node is
modified, an update event is enqueued on the output queue so clients can know to
retrieve the updated data if they are interested.

  thread group 1:
    Stage 1: load Data directory listing (populates pathId map)
    Stage 2: load Data dir crcs (conflict management)
    Stage 3: deep inspection of Data dir data
  thread group 2:
    Stage 1: load group and project list
    Stage 2: load project crcs (conflict management)
    Stage 3: deep inspection of project dir data
  thread group 3: respond to user activity

-- Model Data Structures --
node dictionary (nodeId -> Node)
conflict resolution structures

Performance
-----------
We can increase performance by caching previous calculations on disk (such as
crc, dependency lists, etc.).  These can be considered current if the file size
and modification time are the same.  (es[mp] crc must be recalculated to be
sure)

model state saved in files: basename.<prog start timestamp>.  keep last X
states.  provide "revert state" command

mod group organization is kept in metadata, just like mod ordering already is

use LIFO stack of FIFO "load queues" to allow localized breadth-first loading

Array<nodeGuid, Node>                m_nodes
HashMap<lcase(sourcepath), pathGuid> m_sourcePaths
HashMap<pathGuid, targetPath)        m_targetPaths
HashMap<pathGuid, List<nodeGuid>>    m_conflictLists
HashMap<pathGuid, List<nodeGuid>>    m_activeConflictLists
HashMap<pathGuid, int>               m_installedFileCrcs


Scheduler algorithm:
  if focus request:
    if focusNodeId is None: continue # already handled
    lock focusNodeId
    n = focusNodeId
    focusNodeId = None
    focusPkgNodeId = n.package
    unlock
  elif i/o request:
    acquire write lock on package and perform in this thread
  elif free thread:
    if len(dataLoadCrcSet) > 0:
      if numDataThreads < maxThreads/2
        process uninterruptibly
    elif focusPkgNode is not None:
      if numFocusThreads < maxThreads/3
        process for 2 seconds (load CRCs first, then analyze deps)
    else:
      for unloadedPkgSet in (newPackages, installedPackages,
                             uninstalledPackages, hiddenPackages:
        if len(unloadedPkgSet) > 0
          load package file lists
      for needCrcPkgSet in (newPackages, installedPackages,
                            uninstalledPackages, hiddenPackages:
        if len(needCrcPkgSet) > 0
          load package file CRCs for 2 secs
      if len(dataLoadCrcSet) > 0
        process for 2 secs
      if focusPkg is not None:
        process for 2 secs
      all above again for deps and other analysis stages


Data writer tasks
-----------------
update_crc(nodeId, crc)
  Update CRC field, update attributes and conflict lists for this node and all
conflicting nodes.  conflict list should include (nodeId, crc) so we know which
are the same and which actually conflict

init_node(nodeId, nodeAttributes, children, details)
  update conflict lists if crc is included is is file node

update_path(packageNodeId, path)
  may need to update preview handles for non-archives

update_install_order(nodeId, newPredNodeId)
  must be package or group

update_marked_for_install(nodeId, bool)

reset_marked_for_install(packageNodeId, nodeIds)
  used in wizards

update_preview_handle(nodeId, fileHandle)

mark_package_loaded(packageNodeId)
  mark package as safe to save to persisted state.
