=========================
  Design Considerations
=========================
Modularity
  As with any complex piece of software, the logical components should be as
decoupled as possible to promote clarity, flexibility, and testability.  The
module APIs should hide implementation details well enough for the module
implementations to be changed freely without affecting client modules.

Testability
  An extension of modularity.  Modules should be designed so that their inputs
and outputs (sources and sinks) are encapsulated so that they can be easily
replaced with test harness equivalents (think resource injection).

Responsiveness
  The program should be as prompt as possible to respond to the user.
Therefore, the event loops that respond to user input should be as tight as
possible.  Long-running tasks should be executed asynchronously.

Scalability
  The GIL severely limits concurrency within a single process, artificially
limiting the performance of a multi-threaded application on multi-core machines.
Initially, all components will run in the same process for the sake of
simplicity.  However, once implementation is far enough along to do some
real-world performance testing, it will likely prove beneficial to move one or
more components into separate processes and use Python multiprocessing
primitives for communication.  The module APIs should be designed to allow this
transition to be transparent.

Graceful degradation
  If possible, out of memory errors should not result in program termination.
Instead, caches should be dropped or loaded data should be swapped to disk.
Another possible solution is to split memory-using hot spots into different
processes and allow the OS to do any needed swapping.

Unicode compliance
  All string data read from disk should be converted into some
Unicode-compatible encoding, and all strings that are output should have the
target encoding explicitly specified.

I18n and l10n
  All static text displayed on the UI will follow WB's existing mechanism for
internationalization.  New strings will be added to  WB's localization files as
necessary.


===================
  Design Patterns
===================
As mentioned in the overview document, I chose the MVP (Model View Presenter)
overall design pattern.  Moreover, I chose the "Presentation Model" variant in
order to make the view as "dumb" as possible to minimize the onus of testing the
GUI-bound code.  The external application code interacts only with the View.
The View interacts only with the Presenter, and the Presenter interacts only
with the Model.  All three layers interact with the IO gateway module, but via
separate layer-specific APIs.

The Presenter and Model components implement a degenerate version of the
Observer pattern (i.e. an output message queue read by the component's client),
as there is exactly one observer for each of those components.


==================
  Module Summary
==================
View
- Provides a wx-based GUI that allows users to interact with the data
- Prompt, consistent responsiveness to user actions
- Persists widget-specific state (such as splitter sash positions)
- Captures UI events and informs presenter of pertinent user actions
- Reads ViewCommand bundles from the Presenter's output queue and uses the
contained information to incrementally update the UI
- Contains all localizable text
- Stores settings and retrieves rendered images from the view API in the I/O
Gateway module

Presenter
- Retrieves data from the Model, filters it according to current settings, and
prepares the data for display
- Controls access to Model functionality
- Calculates and streams small, efficient diffs to update view state
- Fulfills requests asynchronously, returning errors as elements in output queue
- Implements wizard scripting logic
- Stores settings and retrieves wizard scripts from the presenter API in the I/O
Gateway module

Model
- Keeps loaded data synchronized with disk contents
- Generates metadata from analysis of loaded data
- Calculates conflict relationships among files
- Coordinates I/O actions (e.g. ensures a project is not deleted while it is
being installed)
- Streams update notifications via its output queue
- Fulfills requests asynchronously, returning errors as elements in output queue
- Stores settings and cached metadata, and performs all I/O operations
through the model API in the I/O Gateway module

I/O Gateway
- Abstracts ALL I/O operations at a level that makes testing the other
components convenient
- Encapsulates knowledge of persisted data

=======================
  Directory Structure
=======================
The code is organized into a directory structure that emphasizes the modularity
of the design:

bait/                   bait public factory functions

bait/model/             model component API classes and constants
bait/presenter/         presenter component API classes and constants
bait/view/              view component API classes and constants
bait/io_gateway/        I/O gateway API classes and constants
bait/util/              utility classes and functions

bait/*/impl/            private implementation.  not intended for outside access

bait/test/              mock objects used in the interactive tests


==================================
  Multiprocessing Considerations
==================================
Logging
  All code uses standard Python logging mechanisms.  Any created subprocesses
must be set up with a logging handler that passes the messages back to the
parent process for output.  This way we can keep the log output ungarbled and
write to rotated log files safely.  Log verbosity for each namespace, regardless
of what process it is running in, is configured by the logging.conf file.

Transparent multiprocessing
  To facilitate testing, components should be able to be used in-process or in a
separate process via the same API.  Components can be abstracted into a separate
process using multiprocessing.Manager objects to create a proxy.  The Manager
object should be initialized with a function that configures logging with an
appropriate logging handler.  All this should be handled transparently by the
bait factory functions.

Lifecycle management
  A python process will not die if it has written something to an output queue
that has not been read yet.  When shutting down, it is imperative to drain all
queues before exiting to avoid leaving hung processes.

Process status monitoring
  Each process should run a monitoring thread that keeps statistics on process
state.  Not only will this let the process know when to reduce memory usage,
but it can also provide the developers with valuable knowledge of real-world
performance, enabling targeted optimizations in future releases.
