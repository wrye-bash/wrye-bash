Title: Wrye Bash Installer Tab View API Specification
Author: Myk Taylor (myk002)
Status: working draft


class View:
  __init__(self, wxParent, presenter, stateManager=None)
    Creates and configures bait widget hierarchies

  start(self)
    Loads saved state, starts threads and subcomponents (including presenter)

  shutdown(self)
    Saves any dirty state, shuts down threads and subcomponents

  pause(self)
    Suggests that bait suspend operations; may not take effect immediately

  resume(self)
    Resumes from a pause



The stateManager object is some abstraction of state-saving functionality.  It may need to be a multiprocess-aware entity if state from all three modules are being written to the same location.  It is mostly TBD.
