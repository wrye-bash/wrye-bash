Author: Myk Taylor (myk002)
Status: working draft


===========
  Context
===========
  The View API will be used by external classes in the Wrye Bash code.  It is
the main API for interacting with the BAIT stack.  BAIT is fairly
self-contained, though, so the only methods required at this level relate to
lifecycle management.
