Author: Myk Taylor (myk002)
Status: working draft


================
  Feature List
================
1) No-wait UI due to asynchronous operation and incremental data loading
  1a) Immediate access to install tab functions, including the ability to leave
	the tab at any time, even if data is not finished loading
  1b) Increased UI responsiveness due to all operations occurring in other
	threads/processes
  1c) Breadth-first loading to grant fast access to top-level data
  1d) Packages that user is actively viewing loaded first, allowing desired
	install actions to be initiated before other irrelevant data is loaded
2) Collapsible package groups
  2a) Create "group" tree nodes to reduce clutter at the top-level
  2b) Allow actions on groups (install, uninstall, move, etc.)
  2c) Add option to ignore conflicts within groups (like tes4edit)
  2d) Auto-group new packages with similar names, or same tesnexus numbers
  2e) Auto-group according user-specified wildcard/regex
3) Direct access to package files
  3a) Can fully expand the structure of packages down to the file level
  3b) Manage circular conflicts
  3c) Open any file with associated program
  3d) Support for rename-on-install of BSA files
4) Searching, filtering, and hiding
  4a) Package toggle filters (Hidden, Installed, Not Installed)
  4b) File toggle filters (Plugins, Resources, Other)
  4c) Hide packages "in place"
  4d) Package search bar with recent search history
  4e) Simple string searches or complex attribute==value queries (whoosh?)
5) Automated package upgrades
  5a) Automatic transition of file selections if upgrading an existing mod
  5b) Automatic moving of updated package to be adjacent to the previous version
  5c) Ini file management
6) Low user impact and smooth transition from existing installer tab
  6a) Bash Installers directory structure untouched
  6b) Autoderivation of package selection state from analysis of installed data
  6c) Will work with existing BAIN wizards
  6d) Can be added as an extra tab and used as a beta alternative to the current
	Installers tab until feature parity is reached, bugs are worked out, and
	user feedback is addressed
7) Capabilities for working with persisted state
  7a) Keep saved state from N previous runs
  7b) Regular automatic backups of state for current run
  7c) On start, automatically find most recent non-corrupt state to load
  7d) User can force a state save
  7e) Ability to manually load state saved from a previous run
  7f) State import/export
8) Feature parity with existing installer tab
  8a) Drag and drop priority reordering
  8b) Dropping packages onto the installers tab from an external source
  8c) All r-click on package actions
  8d) All r-click on header actions
  8e) Select all/none
  8f) Keyboard shortcuts
9) Groundwork for future functionality
  - Automatic creation of "virtual" project containing edited .ini and .esp
      files from an associated project
  - Decomposition and dependency analysis (not only esp->esp, but also
      esp->mesh(bsa), esp->texture(bsa), mesh(bsa)->texture(bsa))
  - Conflict analysis with contents of bsa files
  - Resource (texture, mesh) previews
  - Visual conflict comparison and conflict winner selection
  - Online BCF database, automatic repackaging vs. allowing manual reorg
  - Online wizard database
  - When .esp is selected, display: masters, bash tags, boss notes, mod load
      position (from Gabba)
  - Indicate whether a mod has deleted records (from leandro)
  - Show whether .esp has landscape edits (from Gabba)
  - Detect conflicting worldspace modifications (from Gabba)
  - Caching of esp decomposition from dependency analysis for use in building
      bashed patch (instant bashing)
  - Data directory browser with source package information
  - File type filters for data directory browser (from Gabba)
  - Conflict winner selection from data directory browser
  - TesNexus integration - mod update alerts, description scraping, etc.
  - Automatic bsa invalidation
  - Associate a picture with a BAIN archive or project (from Malonn)
  - Editing an installed .ini file (from Gabba)
  - A special "vanilla Oblivion files" project that backs up any overwritten
      originals (from Gabba)
  - Warning or automatic backup/restore of overwritten origin-unknown files,
      e.g. tweaked .ini, customized .esp (from Gabba)
  - BSA redate button that does what the OBMM "reset timestamps" button does.
      Marks all BSAs as 1/1/2006 (from Arthmoor)
  - Allow wizard.txt outside of archive (i.e. user wizard scripts for existing
      installer archives)
  - Group wizards (e.g. FCOM wizard script encompassing multiple installers)
  - New installer tab functionality available in wizards (rename-on-install,
      select/deselect subtree or file)
  - Recognize simple structure: MyAwesomeMod.7z --> MyAwesomeMod --> readme.txt,
      Data --> mod.esp, Textures, etc. (from Gabba)
  - User-defined weblinks for packages (from Klaus)
  - Ability to mark an esp/m or package as needing manual (un)install steps
      would be nice if this worked on deactivate in mods tab too (from Gabba)
  - Duplicate file detection (from Gabba)
  - Popup warning when installation is in inconsistent state (from Gabba)
  - Undo/redo
  - Make doc viewer grab docs out of the installers
  - Highlight packages/files that currently selected item(s) depend on
  - Attribute filter for search box: "depends on targetnamesubstring"
  - BAIN wizard configuring the ini file for a mod (from andalaybay)
  - A back button on the BAIN wizard (from Psymon)
  - Resizable BAIN wizard elements and window (from Metallicow, Vargr, utumno)
  - Scale images correctly in wizard window (from Metallicow)
  - Create silent voice files for people who don't want voice acting but don't
      have Elys silent voice
  - Merge/compile shaders on install (install like ini tweaks? shader basher?)


==================
  Execution Plan
==================
Note that this is not a /schedule/; it is just a logical sequence of groups of
tasks.  There are no specific dates attached to the phase deliverables.

Phase 0: Planning, design
-------------------------
Goals:
  Create list of requirements (features) that will drive the architecture design
  Design and document proposed architecture and algorithms to sufficient detail
    to enable meaningful discussion with Wrye Bash developers
Additional tasks and notes:
  Research pertinent design patterns and technologies
  Spend time considering possible challenges
  Study WB code to understand style and existing implementation (keeping an eye
    out for integration points post-demo)
  Create personal git repository for change tracking of documents (and
    eventually, the code)
Acceptance criteria:
  Documents checked in and completed to a sufficient level of detail to
  facilitate discussion:
    overview.txt (plus gui mockup)
    project_plan.txt (plus visual timeline)
    architecture.txt (plus diagram)
    func_spec_{model,view,presenter}.txt
    api_spec_{model,view,presenter}.txt
    design_doc_{model,view,presenter}.txt (plus diagrams)
  The *{model,presenter} documents will likely not be fleshed out to the same
    degree as the *view.txt documents
Retrospective:
  Spent about 2 months in my spare time, researched patterns and created several
prototypes before settling on the current proposed architecture
  I feel optimistic about the architecture (it seems both practical and
interesting) and am looking forward to feedback from other developers and
getting things implemented!


Phase 1: View basics, demo
--------------------------
Goals:
  Socialization of ideas
  Developer discussion, consensus, and buy-in
  GUI specification refinement
  Presenter API first draft
Features:
  1a) Immediate access to install tab functions, including the ability to leave
	the tab at any time, even if data is not finished loading
  2a) Create "group" tree nodes to reduce clutter at the top-level
  3a) Can fully expand the structure of packages down to the file level
Additional tasks and notes:
  Fully lay out UI and wire up most of the view internals -- messages will be
    sent to the presenter but functionality will be stubbed out there
  Create interactive UI test
  Deliver UI test code along with all documentation to Wrye Bash developers for
    feedback; iterate until consensus is reached
  In particular, reach consensus on architecture and module func specs
  Integrate with code coverage tools (coverage.py? figleaf?)
  Code review
  Move everything to public repository
  Possible division of labor (if anyone else is interested)
Acceptance criteria:
  View behaves according to agreed-upon functional specification when
    communicating with a mock presenter
  Code is reviewed and tested with high coverage
Retrospective:
  It took several prototypes and an immense amount of research to design the UI.
Usability guidelines, accessibility guidelines, menu organization
considerations, etc., but I believe we finally have something much better than
the original.  Code is now checked into the main Wrye Bash repository (SVN)
under the 'experimental' tree.  It's still just me writing it, though, and
feedback has been minimal.


Phase 2: Presenter basics
-------------------------
Goals:
  Presenter specification refinement
  Presenter API soft freeze
  Model API first draft
  Close relationship with other devs -- ongoing code reviews are important!
Features:
  1b) Increased UI responsiveness due to all operations occurring in other
	threads/processes
  4a) Package toggle filters (Hidden, Installed, Not Installed)
  4b) File toggle filters (Plugins, Resources, Other)
Additional tasks and notes:
  Create comprehensive unit tests for presenter (high code coverage)
  Verify that the presenter can be transparently moved to a different process
  Filter algorithms can be simple; may use search library later
Acceptance criteria:
  Presenter behaves according to func spec when communicating with a mock model
  Integration tests with view pass
  Code is reviewed and tested with high coverage
Retrospective:
  Presenter went very well.  Unit testing and coverage tools (nose with the
coverage plugin) were invaluable.  Need to go back and update the view with
some lessons learned, though.


Phase 3: Model basics
---------------------
Goals:
  Model specification refinement
  Model API soft freeze
Features:
  1c) Breadth-first loading to grant fast access to top-level data
  3b) Manage circular conflicts
  3c) Open any file with associated program
  4c) Hide packages "in place"
  6a) Bash Installers directory structure untouched
Additional tasks and notes:
  Create comprehensive unit tests for model (high code coverage)
  Use programmatic 7z processing instead of running an external process
  No actual I/O actions yet (e.g. can't install yet)
Acceptance criteria:
  Model behaves according to functional spec when reading from specified test
    data set
  Integration tests with presenter and view pass
  Code is reviewed and tested with high coverage


Phase 4: State management

  7d) User can force a state save
  7e) Ability to manually load state saved from a previous run
  7f) State import/export
Additional tasks and notes:
  Unit tests
  Version on-disk formats to facilitate forward and backward compatibility
Acceptance criteria:
  Documentation updated
  Code is reviewed and tested with high coverage


Phase 5: Feature parity, alpha
------------------------------
Goals:
  Release early, release often
  Community feedback
Features:
  6c) Will work with existing BAIN wizards
  6d) Can be added as an extra tab and used as a beta alternative to the current
	Installers tab until feature parity is reached, bugs are worked out, and
	user feedback is addressed
  8a) Drag and drop priority reordering
  8b) Dropping packages onto the installers tab from an external source
  8c) All r-click on package actions
  8d) All r-click on header actions
  8e) Select all/none
  8f) Keyboard shortcuts
Additional tasks and notes:
  When it is made publicly available, clearly label it as "alpha"
  Popup when tab is first clicked, saying what is implemented and what is not
Acceptance criteria:
  For every feature in the old installers tab that makes sense to carry forward,
    there is an analogue in the new installers tab
  Documentation updated
  Code is reviewed and tested with high coverage


Phase 6: Beta
-------------
Goals:
  Harden code as remaining bugs are uncovered by public use
Features:
  1d) Packages that user is actively viewing loaded first, allowing desired
	install actions to be initiated before other irrelevant data is loaded
  2b) Allow actions on groups (install, uninstall, move, etc.)
  2c) Add option to ignore conflicts within groups (like tes4edit)
  3d) Support for rename-on-install of BSA files
Additional tasks and notes:
  Incorporate public feedback
  Work with TomLong and alt3rn1ty regarding "HOWTO" guides
  Bug fixes, refactoring of earlier code, modularize anything that has become
    too complex to grok
  Public poll to help determine priority of remaining planned features/tasks
Acceptance criteria:
  Documentation updated
  Code is reviewed and tested with high coverage
  Generally accepted by the community as ready to be used full-time (we may
still
    decide to keep old tab for a while, though)


Phase 7: Searching
------------------
Goals:
  Increase usability when user has large numbers of mods
Features:
  4d) Package search bar with recent search history
  4e) Simple string searches or complex attribute==value queries (whoosh?)
Additional tasks and notes:
  Research whoosh lib to see if we can get the searching capabilities for "free"
  Make searching by package name really easy and really fast
Acceptance criteria:
  Searching works as expected
  Documentation updated
  Code is reviewed and tested with high coverage


Phase 8: Automation
-------------------
Goals:
  Decrease time user has to spend not playing the game
Features:
  2d) Auto-group new packages with similar names, or same tesnexus numbers
  2e) Auto-group according user-specified wildcard/regex
  5a) Automatic transition of file selections if upgrading an existing mod
  5b) Automatic moving of updated package to be adjacent to the previous version
  5c) Ini file management
Additional tasks and notes:
  Make "auto" functionality optional -- there will always be users that want to
    do things manually
  Research merge tools/libraries that we can leverage
Acceptance criteria:
  Automated features work as expected and are generally regarded as an
    improvement and not a hindrance
  Documentation updated
  Code is reviewed and tested with high coverage


Future features
------------------------
Additional tasks and notes:
  Likely integrate with cbash for file parsing tasks
  Use red background to indicate files/projects that are missing dependencies
  Use external tools (PIL? nvidia tools?) for texture thumbnailing, show
    generated thumbnail in details
  Remember, test at every step.  keep code coverage high.  users deserve high
    quality.
