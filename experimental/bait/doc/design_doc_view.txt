View Internals
--------------
-- View Thread Model and Flow --
The view consists of two threads of execution.  The first is the wxPython event loop thread, and will be the only thread that interacts with GUI elements (since the GUI elements are not thread safe).  It handles all widget events and may call presenter methods as a result.  It also processes GUI-altering commands enqueued by the second thread.

The second thread dequeues ViewCommand objects from the presenter output queue, determines the requested action, and enqueues a callback that will execute the action in the wxPython event queue using CallLater().


Notes
-----
The view should not change presenter- or model- related GUI state directly as a result of user action.  For example, when a user checks a checkbox, the view should not automatically check the item and its children.  The view should notify the presenter of the requested change in check state.  The presenter will, after interacting with the model, enqueue ViewCommand objects that will direct the view to check the appropriate items.  This allows the lower layers to customize the effects of user actions.

Overall, the view should contain minimal logic, as it will receive the least amount of automated testing.
