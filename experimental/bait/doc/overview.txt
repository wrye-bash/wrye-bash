Author: Myk Taylor (myk002)
Status: working draft


=========
  Intro
=========
I have an itch to scratch.  I have been using Wrye Bash for a few years now, and
although it has made great strides in its bashed patch functionality, the
installers tab has remained largely unchanged.  This is not due to neglect, of
course, but rather to the incredible work Wrye (and others since him) have done
there to effectively solve people's mod management needs.

However, as my mod library has grown, so has my frustration with the tab's long
load times and slow response times.  Moreover, I am tired of repeating routine
multi-step tasks, such as upgrading a mod and transferring INI settings, that
seem like they can (and should) be automated.  Once I got thinking, I came up
with a whole slew of features and usability improvements that would make Wrye
Bash more useful and convenient.

Finally, this gives me the opportunity to learn Python, work with some excellent
developers and community members, and contribute something valuable to a tool
that has been, and continues to be, indispensable to a large number of people.

I realize that this document describes a lot of work, and I have no idea what my
future will grant me in terms of free time in which to do it.  If I can't
actually get everything done myself, my hope is that I can at least provide a
solid foundation, and solid documentation, on which others can build.  I do note
that the work done here should remain relevant for quite some time, as the
problems that this tool solves tend to recur in a wide variety of games.  Even
if popular enthusiasm for Oblivion fades, a few changes makes the program just
as useful for Fallout3, Skyrim, or pretty much any other moddable game out
there.


==============
  Background
==============
For readers unfamiliar with Wrye Bash, it is a mod management tool for the game
"The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion".  Its two main features are the Bashed Patch,
a mechanism for combining multiple conflicting mods into a functioning whole,
and the BAIN installer, a mod management system that keeps track of individual
file origins and guarantees a consistent installed fileset at all times (i.e. it
"heals" the installed files after one component is uninstalled).

This document describes the proposed next version of the BAIN installer and its
UI, the Installers tab.


=========
  Goals
=========
Primary Goals
-------------
- Make common use cases fast and easy:
    clicking on the Installers tab and organizing/installing new packages
    clicking on the Installers tab just to find and check/modify settings for a
      single package
    upgrading to a later version of a package
- Enhance the general usability of the installers tab
- Actively prevent inadvertent loss of work/data

Secondary Goals
---------------
- Create an extensible framework that facilitates the addition of future
    functionality while keeping complexity manageable
- Extract, analyze, and present more information about mods and resource files


===================
  Feature Summary
===================
1) No-wait UI due to asynchronous operation and incremental data loading
2) Collapsible groups in the UI enabling hierarchical package organization
3) Granular access to package contents
4) Searching, filtering, and hiding of displayed data
5) Automated package upgrades
6) Low user impact and smooth transition from existing installer tab
7) Capabilities for working with persisted state
8) Feature parity with existing installers tab
9) Groundwork for future functionality

Please see project_plan.txt for details.

  UI Overview
===============
When the Installers tab first appears, a tree of groups and packages will begin
to be populated based on saved preferences and the current contents of the Bash
Installers directory.  The packages shown can be filtered via three toggle
elements displayed at the top of the tree: Hidden, Installed, and Not Installed.
A panel to the right of the packages tree shows details on the selected
package.  A tree below the package details panel shows the file hierarchy of the
currently selected package, again with various toggle filters.  A search bar
above the packages tree can filter the shown packages further, restricted to the
scope of the selected toggles.  A panel to the right of the file tree displays
details about the selected file.  A small, one-line panel between the search bar
and the installers tree view indicates the status of the BAIN system, such
as whether all data has been loaded or whether a package is currently being
installed.  All in all, the appearance is similar to the existing UI layout, and
should be immediately familiar to any long-time user of Wrye Bash.

As more detailed information is loaded/derived about the packages displayed in
the tree, they may change their appearance, e.g. they might acquire an orange
background color to indicate that they are out of sync with the installed data.
Likewise, if an installed package were deleted from the Bash Installers
directory, the status panel would acquire the orange background color.  If
anything is currently selected when its metadata is updated, the information in
the appropriate details panel is automatically refreshed.  At any time, packages
and groups can be dragged around the tree to reorganize their relative priority
in resolving conflicting file lists.

The current notion of checking subpackages and esp/m files is extended to cover
all installable files in a package (non-installable files can be double-clicked
to be opened in an associated application, but cannot be marked for
installation).  The user can make any number of changes to which files will be
installed/uninstalled before r-clicking one or more out-of-sync packages and
selecting "Anneal".

Please see the func_spec_view.txt document for further details on UI behavior
and gui_mockup.png for a visual representation of the GUI layout described
above.


==================
  Design Summary
==================
To reiterate the primary goals listed at the beginning of this document, this
proposal seeks to make common use cases, such as clicking on the Installers tab
and organizing/installing new mods, clicking on the Installers tab just to
review or modify settings for a single mod, or upgrading to a later version of a
mod fast and easy.  It also attempts to enhance the overall usability of the
installers tab, as well as to provide a foundation on which future features can
be added without impacting the time the user has to wait before performing
desired actions.

The central theme that this design is based on to achieve the above goals is
asynchronous, incremental loading.  In contrast to the existing installer tab,
this design calls for no preloading sequence at all.  The tab is shown instantly
(allowing the user to leave the tab just as quickly if the tab were clicked by
mistake), and packages are added to the browsing tree as they are loaded.
Metadata about the packages is added to the visual representation as it becomes
available.  In this way, the list of packages is accessible very quickly so the
user can reorder packages and start marking items for installation.  More
complex information such as determining conflict winners is loaded more slowly,
and may be retroactively applied if the user installed a package before its
conflicts were known.  Thus, functionality can be layered incrementally, and the
user only has to wait long enough for the desired layer to be loaded.  Moreover,
we can determine areas of user interest by monitoring click activity and load
those areas at a higher priority, further enhancing the user experience.

To manage the complexity of the code required for this, I chose the MVP (Model
View Presenter) design pattern.  I chose this pattern over other similar
patterns, such as MVC (Model View Controller) since there is significant
functionality represented by the presenter module which would have been lumped
into the view in MVC.  GUI components are notoriously difficult to test, so it
made sense to minimize the logic housed in the view.  Moreover I wanted to keep
the Python GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) that services the code that responds to
user events as unencumbered as possible to promote UI responsiveness.

Please see architecture.txt and architecture_overview.jpg for more details on
the modules and their interactions.
