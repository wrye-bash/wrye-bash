Model
  Keeps loaded data synchronized with disk contents
  Generates metadata from analysis of saved state and loaded data
  Calculates conflict relationships among files
  Performs system actions (e.g. copies the files to the target directory)
  Streams update notifications to presenter
  All actions performed asynchronously.  errors come back as elements in update queue
  Projects movable immediately
  Projects installable as soon as data dir finishes loading (end of thread group 1, stage 2)

Data file backup could take the form of a permanently marked-for-install "virtual project" at the top (lowest priority) of the tree. This would have the convenient side effect of restoring the original files when the overwrites are uninstalled. It might be difficult to decide what gets copied in to the virtual project, though, if it's not just constrained to a "vanilla files" list. I wouldn't want to get in a state where an install has been "forgotten" (due to database deletion), then when the user reinstalls projects, /everything/ gets copied to the backup project.
