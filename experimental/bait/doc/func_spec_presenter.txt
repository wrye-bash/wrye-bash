Overview
--------
The presenter makes all decisions about how data is displayed and implements all
filtering and searching algorithms.  It also handles wizard script execution.
It is called by the view to communicate user actions.  It calls the model to
perform low-level actions, retrieve data, and to communicate current areas of
interest so the model can focus its calculations.  It reads from the model
update queue and writes commands to the view queue.  It also communicates with
the Presenter I/O gateway for file-related tasks, such as settings persistence
and wizard script retrieval.
