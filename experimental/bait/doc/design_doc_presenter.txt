Author: Myk Taylor (myk002)
Status: working draft


See component_diagram_presenter.* for a visual representation of the following
design.


================
  Design Goals
================
1) Be super-responsive to UI events.  This means that events received from the
model are low priority
2) Send minimal updates to the UI -- diffs instead of wipe/rebuild sequences


================
  Thread Model
================
There are three types of input to the presenter.  The first is the group of
model-bound operations -- menu item selections, mostly -- that get sanity
checked and passed on to the model, all within the calling thread.

The second is the group of widget events that affect the state of the widget
managers.  These get enqueued as a "state change event" in the manager-specific
queue, so each manager's thread can modify its internal state safely.  Widget
events may also call the manager's "head's up" API directly to notify it that a
particular kind of state change event is in the pipe.  This lets the manager
know to skip certain kinds of processing that will be obsoleted soon by the
pending state change event.

The third is the update notifications read from the model output queue.  These
are dispatched to the relevant widget manager, which checks it for relevance
and, if it is relevant, passes it to the data loading thread.  The data loading
thread will make an asynchronous call to the model and then enqueue the loaded
data as a state change event for the widget manager.

The most complicated components are the widget managers, which must manage
interactions among multiple threads:
- the update dispatcher thread when it checks for relevance
- the out-of-band "head's up" calls from widget events
- out-of-band state change notifications from other widget managers
- the internal processing thread that dequeues from the state change queue


===========
  Classes
===========
Update Dispatcher
-----------------
API:
  __init__(self, modelUpdateQueue, viewCommandQueue, widgetManagers)
  start(self)
  shutdown_output(self) # after this returns no more updates will be processed
  shutdown_input(self) # after this returns, processing thread has been joined

Data:
  Queue _modelUpdateQueue
  Queue _viewCommandQueue
  list _widgetManagers
  Thread _monitorThread

Algorithm:
  pop _modelUpdateNotificationQueue
    if None, break
    if error, propagate to view
    send to each widget manager in turn until one handles it
    TODO: would it be faster if we map update types directly to managers?


DataFetcher
-----------
API:
  __init__(self, numThreads)
  start(self)
  shutdown(self)
  async_fetch(self, nodeId, updateTypeMask, stateChangeQueue)
  _fetch_loop(self)

Data:
  Queue _fetchQueue
  list<Thread> _fetchThreads # each runs _fetch_loop
  bool _shutdown
  Model _model

Algorithm:
  async_fetch
    if _shutdown: return
    else: enqueue on _fetchQueue

  shutdown
    set shutdown flag
    drain queue and ignore popped elements
    enqueue a None for each thread
    join threads

  _fetch_loop
    while True
      pop _fetchQueue
      if None, break
      for each update type in mask, request data from model
      enqueue results in stateChangeQueue


Widget Manager Base
-------------------
API:
  __init__(self, dataFetcher, viewUpdateQueue)
  start(self)
  shutdown(self)
  bool handle_update(self, modelUpdateNotification)
  bool _is_relevant(self, modelUpdateNotification) # default impl returns True

Data:
  Queue _viewUpdateQueue    # output queue
  DataFetcher _dataFetcher  # async data fetching engine
  Queue _stateChangeQueue   # input queue to internal thread
  Thread _processingThread  # internal thread

Algorithm:
  handle_update
    check update for scope; if out of scope, return False
    if in scope, check relevance
    if relevant, send to dataFetcher
    return True


Filters
-------
This design is approximate.  I suspect we will use a hierarchy of filter
classes.  One filter class for each filter defined in the UI, then aggregate
filters that combine them in proper AND and OR groups, then top-level filters
that represent all filters that affect a particular widget.  Filters keep their related UI button labels up to date.

API:
  __init__(self, viewUpdateQueue)
  bool matches(self, nodeId, nodeAttributes)
  remove(self, nodeId) # remove nodeId from _matchedSet
  bool set_active_mask(self, filterMask)  # returns whether state was changed
  update_view(self) # send ViewUpdateCommand to update filter btn state/label
  reset(self) # clear sets
  set get_matched_node_ids(self)

Data:
  int _idMask # can be multiple filter ids or'd together for aggregate fitlers
  bool _active
  set _matchedSet # used by underlying individual filters
  set _visibleSet # used by top-level filters

Algorithm:
  matches
    if node matches filter, add to _matchedSet
    if node matches all filters, add to _visibleSet
    if node matches and filter is enabled, return true; otherwise false

  set_filter_mask
    re-evaluate _visibleSet and _enabled and return whether _visibleSet changed


Diff Engine
-----------
Diff engine thread reads from state change queue.  This is the only thread that
can touch the tree state or send view commands.  Out-of-band calls may set
flags that are read by the diff engine thread during processing so the diff
engine knows when to ignore current filters (for example).  Out-of-band calls
should usually be accompanied by a state change object enqueued for the diff
engine thread.  There will be at least two different diff engines (for the
packages tree and for the package contents), so this design is approximate.

API:
  __init__(self, viewCommandQueue)
  set_filter_mask(self, filterMask)
  set_selected_node_ids(self, nodeIds)
  other methods that describe the different state changes for the diff engine

Data:
  Filter _filters

Algorithm:
  When nodes are added, updated, or removed, the diff engine informs the
filters so they can keep their sets and statistics up to date.  When items are
added/removed from the visible set, the diff engine sends the appropriate
updates to the view.  When user selections change, or when filter changes change
the number of visible selected items, the diff engine informs any interested
widget managers so they can set their foci.
