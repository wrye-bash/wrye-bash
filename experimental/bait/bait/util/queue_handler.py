An example script showing how to use logging with multiprocessing.

The basic strategy is to set up a listener process which can have any logging
configuration you want - in this example, writing to rotated log files. Because
only the listener process writes to the log files, you don't have file
corruption caused by multiple processes trying to write to the file.

The listener process is initialised with a queue, and waits for logging events
(LogRecords) to appear in the queue. When they do, they are processed according
to whatever logging configuration is in effect for the listener process.

Other processes can delegate all logging to the listener process. They can have
a much simpler logging configuration: just one handler, a QueueHandler, needs
to be added to the root logger. Other loggers in the configuration can be set
up with levels and filters to achieve the logging verbosity you need.

A QueueHandler processes events by sending them to the multiprocessing queue
that it's initialised with.

In this demo, there are some worker processes which just log some test messages
and then exit.

This script was tested on Ubuntu Jaunty and Windows 7.
