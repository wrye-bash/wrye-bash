== Bashed Lists ===================================================#
This is a merge file created by __Wrye Bash__. 

== Contents
===Alchemical Catalogs
* Book catalogs of all alchemical ingredients sorted by ingredient name and effect. 
* These are updated versions of the allchemical catalogs found in __Cobl Main.esm__ and will only be created if __Cobl Main__ is included in the load list.

===Merged Lists
* Merged versions of currently conflicting lists.

== To Update
* In __Wrye Bash__...
* Select the mods that you want to merge. Usually this will be your current set of load mods, and so should already be loaded.
* On the __Mods__ tab, right click on the __Bashed Lists__ mod and then select __Import: Merged Lists__.
* In the resulting mod, check **only releveling** mods. All mods shown, ~~whether checked or not~~ will be allowed to add new items to the list, but the checked mods can also remove items from the lists. (Releveling work by removing and shifting items on lists.)
* Click Okay.
* **Note:** If you have different loads lists for different games, you can use a different __Bashed List__ mod for each loadset. Just duplicate an existing Bashed List, rename it to something like __Bashed List, Alpha.esp__ and then update it with the correct set of mods loaded.

== Notes 
This is an esp-on-esp mod -- i.e., it has esps as masters. While the game will accept this fine, TESCS will not. Do not try to edit this in TESCS.
