[color=orange]Important: Wrye Bash's developers have been MIA for quite some time due to various real life circumstances. As such, development slowed to a crawl with only a few modders that didn't have much experience with Python (in which Bash is written) trying to fix existing bugs.  Starting with version 303 Wrye Bash is the product of these attempted bug fixes on top of what was done before the developers went MIA. As such, it is not a polished release.  

If you are familiar with the Python programming language, please consider helping with development. Many of Wrye Bash's features are unique to it, and it needs fixes to outstanding bugs at the least to stay usable.  [url=https://sourceforge.net/p/oblivionworks/bugs/]Our bug tracker[/url] lists everything we're aware of at present.[/color]

[size=3][color=#3366ff]What does Wrye Bash do?[/color][/size]

[list]
[*]It makes it safe to try out new mods because it will restore everything to the way it was when you uninstall a mod
[*]It makes more mods compatible with each other by importing information from different mods into a "bashed patch"
[*]It allows you to exceed the 255 mod threshold by automatically merging mods for you

[size=3][color=#3366ff]Requirements and Installation:[/color][/size]

I suggest looking here for the approproate version [url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2019667]Latest Supported Visual C++ Downloads[/url].  The previous link may have more up to date information but here are some direct links [url=http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5553]MSVC++ 2005 Redistributable Suite SP1[/url], [url=http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=10986]MSVC++ 2008 SP1 Redistributable[/url], [url=http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=23691]MSVC++ 2010 Redistributable Service Pack 1[/url], [url=http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30679]MSVC++ 2012 Redistributable Update 3[/url].

[size=2][color=#3366ff]Short version:[/color][/size] 
 
Just use the installer and install to the Skyrim folder! When you install dependencies, just install them to their default locations.
 
[size=2][color=#3366ff]Long version:[/color][/size] 

There are two versions available: the Python version and the Standalone version. They are functionally equivalent. Most people should run the Standalone version since it is slightly simpler (no external Python components to install). You don't need to install the Python version, however, you can if you want to be more involved with development or if you already have Python installed on your system for other reasons.
 
First, if you're using Windows XP, Wrye Bash needs the [url=http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=14431]MSVC++ 2005 SP1 Redistributable with ATL Security Update[/url] installed, the x86 version. This is required for the custom 7z executable that Wrye Bash uses to run. Later versions of Windows already have this installed.
 
If you're using the Standalone version, the only other thing you need to install manually is the [url=http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=a5c84275-3b97-4ab7-a40d-3802b2af5fc2]MSVC++ 2008 Redistributable[/url].
 
If you are using the Python version, dependency installation will be handled automatically by the installer. However, if you want or need to do things manually:
 
[url=http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.3/python-2.7.3.msi]Python 2.7.3[/url]
[url=http://sourceforge.net/projects/wxpython/files/wxPython/2.8.12.1/wxPython2.8-win32-unicode-2.8.12.1-py27.exe]wxPython 2.8.12.1 unicode for Python 2.7[/url]
[url=http://sourceforge.net/projects/comtypes/files/comtypes/0.6.2/comtypes-0.6.2.win32.exe/download]comtypes 0.6.2[/url]
[url=http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/Build]PyWin32 for Python 2.7[/url]

Other setups [i]may[/i] work, but this is the only officially supported setup.
Python 3.x: [b]NOT supported[/b]
 
Note that the 32-bit versions are required even if you are on a 64-bit operating system
Then:
[LIST]
[*]For manual installations of either the Standalone or Python versions, extract the archive in your Skyrim game folder so that the Mopy directory appears in the Skyrim directory[/*]
[*]For Python versions, run by double-clicking on Wrye Bash Launcher.pyw[/*]
[*]For WBSA (Wrye Bash StandAlone), run by double-clicking on Wrye Bash.exe[/*]
[/LIST]
Remember! In Windows Vista and up, don't install Skyrim in the Program Files folder due to User Account Control! See File Permissions.
