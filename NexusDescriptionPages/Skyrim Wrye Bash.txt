[center][color=red][size=6]Requires Skyrim version 1.8.151.0.7 or higher.[/size][/color][/center]
[center][color=red][size=6]NOT SUPPORTED ON OLDER VERSIONS!!![/size][/color][/center]

[color=orange]Important: Wrye Bash's developers have been MIA for the last few months due to various real life circumstances. As such, development has slowed to a crawl with only a few modders that don't have much experience with Python (in which Bash is written) trying to fix existing bugs.

v303 is the product of these attempted bug fixes on top of what was done before the developers went MIA. As such, it is not a polished release.

Finally, if you are familiar with the Python programming language, please consider helping with development. Many of Wrye Bash's features are unique to it, and it needs fixes to outstanding bugs at the least to stay usable.

[b]What does Wrye Bash do?[/b]
[list]
[*]It makes it safe to try out new mods because it will restore everything to the way it was when you uninstall a mod
[*]It makes more mods compatible with each other by importing information from different mods into a "bashed patch"
[*]It allows you to exceed the 255 mod threshold by automatically merging mods for you

[b]Requirements and Installation[/b]: Short version: just use the installer and install Wrye Bash to the Skyrim folder!
Remember! In Windows Vista and up, don't install your games in the Program Files folder due to User Access Controls (UAC).

- Fixed issue with Oblivion introduced in r2952. [wrinklyninja]
- [Skyrim] It is now impossible to deactivate Skyrim.esm and Update.esm, the game force loads them. [d4id4los]

- Fix for Bug #258 "#258 LO mismatch between loadorder.txt and plugins.txt causes a crash on statup" [d4id4los]
- Fix for bug #251 "'Do you want to enable Installers?' dialog throws exception". [d4id4los]
