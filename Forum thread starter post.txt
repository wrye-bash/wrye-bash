Continuing from the [topic=1205502]previous thread[/topic]...

Wrye Bash is a multi-featured mod and savegame management tool for Oblivion.  Its primary purpose is to enable you to play your game with multiple mods that would not otherwise work well together (due to the way the mod system works, this is true for most mods that exist).

Its two best-known features are the Bashed Patch, which allows you to enable multiple overlapping mod plugins and have them work together sensibly, and the BAIN installation framework, an easy-to-use interface for installing and uninstalling mods that automatically heals your game data when multiple mods try to install the same files.  Related to and beyond these, it also has many capabilities targeted at mod creators and power users.

[b]FAQ of the day[/b]: What is CBash?
CBash is basically an elder scrolls master (.esm) and elder scrolls plugin (.esp) file parser. It is written in C, and allows us to build Bashed Patches much faster on most systems than the current python code. Moreover, CBash parses more types of records than the python code does, since parsing those records in python would be prohibitively slow. The practical benefits of using CBash are:
[list=1]
[*] building the bashed patch is much faster (for most people -- if it is slower on your system please post your system specs, operating system version, etc.)
[*] more plugins are mergeable, giving you the ability to cram more goodness into Oblivion
[*] in the future, more interesting kinds of tweaks will be practical to implement
[/list]There are some technical differences from the python-based parser in how it makes the parsed data available, and this is why there are currently a few bugs. There's nothing wrong with CBash, per se, it's just that the merging and importing logic in python needs to be rethought in order to use the CBash framework.  [b]At this stage CBash is in BETA.[/b]

[b]Requirements and Installation[/b]:[spoiler][list]
[*] If you're using the Standalone version, which has the Python dependencies embedded, the only thing you need to install is the [url=http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/confirmation.aspx?familyid=ba9257ca-337f-4b40-8c14-157cfdffee4e&displaylang=en"]MSVC++ 2008 Redistributable[/url].
[*] If you are using the Installer or manual version, it's easiest just to install the WryePython04a package: [url=http://tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=22368]TESNexus[/url] | [url=http://www.fliggerty.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=54&t=4233]GHF[/url].  However, if you want or need to do things manually:[spoiler][list]

  [*]If you are installing for the first time, make sure you have installed [url=http://tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=22368]WryePython04a[/url] (unless you plan on using the Standalone version).
  [*]Download and run the installer for the most recent release.  You can upgrade this way too.
  [*]For manual installations/upgrades, download the archive version and extract in your Oblivion game folder (so that the Mopy directory appears in the Oblivion directory)
  [*]For WBSA (Wrye Bash StandAlone) versions, no Python components are required, but remember it is a beta and there are currently issues (see the section under [b]Reporting Bugs[/b].)

[b]Reporting Bugs[/b]: Try to give us enough information to diagnose your problem.  The following is useful information for us:[spoiler][list]
[*]What are all the symptoms?  Be sure to include what you did (step-by-step is helpful), what you expected, and what happened.
[*]If Oblivion isn't installed in the default location, where is it installed?
[*]What version of the python components are installed?
 [list]
 [*]Python
 [*]wxPython
 [*]ComTypes
 [*]psyco
 [*]PyWin32
 [/list][*]What version of Windows are you using?  Is UAC enabled?
[*]Does the problem exist if you disable CBash (rename CBash.dll to any other name and restart Wrye Bash)?
[*]What version of Wrye Bash are you using?  If you're using the SVN, be sure to include the revision number.
[*]Are you using a bash.ini?  If so, include its contents (in spoiler tags, please!)
[*]Is the problem related to the Bashed Patch?  If so include the following:[list]
 [*]Your Load Order (in spoiler tags).  Get this by right clicking on a column header in the Mods tab, and selecting 'List Mods...'
 [*]Your Bashed Tags (in spoiler tags).  Get this by right clicking on a column header in the Mods tab, and selecting 'List Bash Tags...'
 [*]Your Bashed Patch config (in spoiler tags).  Get this by right clicking on the Bashed Patch and selecting 'List Patch Config...'[/list]
[*]If you're using the WBSA, things are a bit trickier.  There are currently a few known issues:[list=1]
[*]Wrye Bash wont work correctly if you launch it from the command line (DOS).  Always launch by double clicking the exe or a shortcut to it.
[*]Due to issue #1, no debug mode is available.  Some errors that happen will still be printed either to a "Wrye Bash.exe.txt" file, or to the "stdout/stderr" window that shows up with errors sometimes.
[*]There may be plenty more...just think of them as "undocumented features"[/list][*]If you think you've found an error in the WBSA, be sure to uninstall ALL python components and test it again first, to be sure we get an accurate report.  Having python installed can sometimes trick the WBSA into thinking that it has all of the files it requires, even if it really doesn't.[/list]

[b]Linking[/b]: If you'd like to link to Bash from somewhere else, please do!

=== 293 [27/6/2011] [PacificMorrowind,Lojack,myk002,valda] [rev 1280][spoiler][list]
[*] Bashed Patch:[list]
  [*] Bugs fixed (CBash):[list]
    [*] Filter mods that were incorrectly being treated as not mergeable are mergeable once again.
    [*] Bug with the NPC AI Packages patcher fixed (incorrectly detecting if OOO and the UOP were installed).
    [*] Bash will now propery report mergeable mods that have active non-mergeable dependant mods as not mergeable.
    [*] Hack added to make sure that OOO.esp is reported as non-mergeable.
    [*] Fix for mergeability detection for corrupted/unrecognized format mods (presume non-mergeable and warn if in debug mode but don't fail - which could prevent rebuilding of patch in CBash mode).
    [*] NPC Face data should properly be merged, vice overridden.
    [*] Fixed merging of QUST records from Filter mods.[/list]  [*] Tweak Assorted: Default Icons updated to skip records that should not have icons (stageless quests, non-playable clothing, armor, and items).
  [*] Added ability to import Bashed Patch config from CBash to Python and Python to CBash.
  [*] Added the ability to build a Python Bashed Patch when CBash is active.  This now requires that a Python based [[#|Mark Mergeable]] to be automatically executed before rebuilding.[list]
    [*] No more renaming CBash.dll![/list]  [*] 'Revert to Saved' option, to restore the settings last used to build the Bashed Patch.[/list][*] Bugs fixed (General):[list]
  [*] Fixed multiple issues dealing with '&' (ampersand) in filenames.
  [*] BOSS's dirty edit CRC's will be properly read from the masterlist now.
  [*] Updated format of forum-postable text copied to clipboard (e.g. "List mods" output) so that the title appears ouside of the spoiler tag as requested by speedyg869 [url=http://forums.bethsoft.com/index.php?app=forums&module=forums&section=findpost&pid=17975809]here[/url]
  [*] Fixed the launching of OBSE when a Steam install is detected.[/list][*] Updated NSIS installer.
[*] Unicode Mode:[list]
  [*] Bugs fixed:[list]
    [*] debug printing failing of an error in reading a mod failing with some unicode mods.
    [*] Rename Player
    [*] Rename Save items (including Enchanted, Potions, Spells)[/list][/list][*] Startup:[list]
  [*] refactored cmdline opt getting
  [*] added/changed cmdline options:[list]
    [*] -d/--debug: no longer automatically disables Psyco import.
    [*] --no-psyco: disable Psyco import.
    [*] -C/--Cbash-mode: force cbash mode (requires CBash.dll to be named one of Rename_CBash.dll, CBash.dll or _CBash.dll).
    [*] -P/--Python-mode: force python mode (whether or not CBash.dll exists).
    [*] -U/--Unicode: equivalent to setting [b]bEnableUnicode[/b] to [i]True[/i] in bash.ini (but the cmdline options overide the ini when specified).
    [*] -A/--Ansi: equivalent to setting [b]bEnableUnicode[/b] to [i]False[/i] in bash.ini (but the cmdline options overide the ini when specified).
    [*] -i/--include-changed-images: includes changed images in mopy/images in backup/restore (if present in backup file) operation.
    [*] -I/--include-all-images: include all images in mopy/images in backup/restore (if present in backup file) operation.[/list][/list][*] Preliminary support for BOSS 1.8[/list][/spoiler]
