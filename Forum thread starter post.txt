Continuing from the [topic=1209199]previous thread[/topic]...

Wrye Bash is a multi-featured mod and savegame management tool for Oblivion.  Its primary purpose is to enable you to play your game with multiple mods that would not otherwise work well together (due to the way the mod system works, this is true for most mods that exist).

Its two best-known features are the Bashed Patch, which allows you to enable multiple overlapping mod plugins and have them work together sensibly, and the BAIN installation framework, an easy-to-use interface for installing and uninstalling mods that automatically heals your game data when multiple mods try to install the same files.  Related to and beyond these, it also has many capabilities targeted at mod creators and power users.

[b]FAQ of the day[/b]: What is CBash?
CBash is basically an elder scrolls master (.esm) and elder scrolls plugin (.esp) file parser. It is written in C, and allows us to build Bashed Patches much faster on most systems than the current python code. Moreover, CBash parses more types of records than the python code does, since parsing those records in python would be prohibitively slow. The practical benefits of using CBash are:
[list=1]
[*] building the bashed patch is much faster (for most people -- if it is slower on your system please post your system specs, operating system version, etc.)
[*] more plugins are mergeable, giving you the ability to cram more goodness into Oblivion
[*] in the future, more interesting kinds of tweaks will be practical to implement
[/list]There are some technical differences from the python-based parser in how it makes the parsed data available, and this is why there are currently a few bugs. There's nothing wrong with CBash, per se, it's just that the merging and importing logic in python needs to be rethought in order to use the CBash framework.  [b]At this stage CBash is in BETA.[/b]

[b]Requirements and Installation[/b]: Remember! In Windows Vista and up, don't install Oblivion in the Program Files folder due to UAC![spoiler][list]
[*]If you're using the Standalone version, which has the Python dependencies embedded, the only thing you need to install is the [url=http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/confirmation.aspx?familyid=ba9257ca-337f-4b40-8c14-157cfdffee4e&displaylang=en"]MSVC++ 2008 Redistributable[/url].
[*]If you are using the Installer or manual version, it's easiest just to install the WryePython04a package: [url=http://tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=22368]TESNexus[/url] | [url=http://www.fliggerty.com/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=54&t=4233]GHF[/url].  However, if you want or need to do things manually:[spoiler][list]
  [*]Included in Wrye Python 04a:[list]
    [*][url="http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.1/python-2.7.1.msi"]Python 2.7.1[/url]

  [*]Python 3.x: [b][u]NOT Supported[/u][/b]
[/list][/spoiler]
[*]Note that the 32-bit versions are required even if you are on a 64-bit operating system[/list]
[list]
  [*]If you are installing for the first time, make sure you have installed [url=http://tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=22368]WryePython04a[/url] (unless you plan on using the Standalone version).
  [*]Download and run the installer for the most recent release.  You can upgrade this way too.
  [*]For manual installations/upgrades, download the archive version and extract in your Oblivion game folder (so that the Mopy directory appears in the Oblivion directory)
  [*]For WBSA (Wrye Bash StandAlone) versions, no Python components are required, but remember it is a beta and there are currently issues (see the section under [b]Reporting Bugs[/b].)

[b]Development[/b]:
The project is hosted at [url="https://sourceforge.net/projects/oblivionworks/develop"]SourceForge[/url].  Want a feature?  Request it [url="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=284958&atid=1207904"]here[/url]!  Found a bug?  Report it [url="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=284958&atid=1207901"]here[/url]!  You don't need a SourceForge account to create or add data to bug reports and feature requests -- you can always contribute anonymously (but put your name in the comments section if you want credit : ).  Feeling brave?  SVN versions are not guaranteed to be release quality, but if you know what you're doing and want to help us test new features and track down bugs, follow alt3rn1ty's SVN guide to use the latest code:
[spoiler]
Read all of this [b]before taking any action[/b] (what you do will depend upon which Wrye Bash you have (Standalone or Python) - the most important part being if you have Wrye Bash 293 Python version installed (or previous versions of Wrye Bash before 293), then see NB further down concerning the directory structure change)

If going from Standalone version to Python version, you are going to need to install Wrye Python 04a (from TESNexus) (if you already have it installed, there is no need to install it again)

The latest svn is always here >>[url=http://oblivionworks.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/oblivionworks/Programs/Wrye%20Bash/]Click and Bookmark it[/url]<< - Then just click "Download GNU Tarball" at the bottom.  Note: If you have been told to try a specific revision number instead of the latest, type the revision number in the sticky revision box and press return, the Download GNU Tarball will now grab that revision's set of files.

Use >>[url=http://oblivionworks.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/oblivionworks/Programs/?view=log]this link[/url]<< to view the log of changes for reference to specific revision numbers and their changes, to revert to as necessary if things go wrong ...

[color="#FF8C00"]NB[/color] - For people using 293 Python version (or an earlier version of Wrye Bash) installed (including Standalone users who have just installed 293 Python version), there is one further step you need to take BEFORE copying Mopy\ and Data\ from the svn into Oblivion\ (see screenshot 4 and a Half below) .... The svn has a new directory structure since the release of 293 Python version - delete your existing Mopy\ folder in ~path to game installation~\Oblivion\, then copy the new svn Data\ and Mopy\ folders into ~path to game installation~\Oblivion\.  Once you have changed to the svn, you can just copy Mopy\ and Data\ from newer revisions of the svn and overwrite the previous revision you had, saying yes to all (currently this procedure should overwrite 491 files).

[color="#FF8C00"]A screenshot walkthrough:[/color]

Rinse and repeat when a new svn comes out (minus Screenshot 4 and a Half).

[color="#FF8C00"]Beware:[/color] Its a good idea to rename and keep the tarball (the one I downloaded above immediately got renamed svn 1405). Keep a few weeks worth of them, so if there is a problem found later with a particular set of committed files in the Tarball you can go back to a last known good revision, extract it and copy over mopy\ and data\ as usual - Putting you back to a working copy of Wrye Bash, there's no need to go back this far but note svn revision 1309 was the directory structure change. Keep an eye on these Wrye Bash threads for developments.[/spoiler]

[b]Reporting Bugs[/b]: Try to give us enough information to diagnose your problem.  The following is useful information for us:[spoiler][list]
[*]What are all the symptoms?  Be sure to include what you did (step-by-step is helpful), what you expected, and what happened.
[*]If Oblivion isn't installed in the default location, where is it installed?
[*]What version of the python components are installed?
 [list]
 [*]Python
 [*]wxPython
 [*]ComTypes
 [*]psyco
 [*]PyWin32
 [/list][*]What version of Windows are you using?  Is UAC enabled?
[*]Does the problem exist if you disable CBash (rename CBash.dll to any other name and restart Wrye Bash)?
[*]What version of Wrye Bash are you using?  If you're using the SVN, be sure to include the revision number.
[*]Are you using a bash.ini?  If so, include its contents (in spoiler tags, please!)
[*]Is the problem related to the Bashed Patch?  If so include the following:[list]
 [*]Your Load Order (in spoiler tags).  Get this by right clicking on a column header in the Mods tab, and selecting 'List Mods...'
 [*]Your Bashed Tags (in spoiler tags).  Get this by right clicking on a column header in the Mods tab, and selecting 'List Bash Tags...'
 [*]Your Bashed Patch config (in spoiler tags).  Get this by right clicking on the Bashed Patch and selecting 'List Patch Config...'[/list]
[*]If you're using the WBSA, things are a bit trickier.  There are currently a few known issues:[list=1]
[*]Wrye Bash wont work correctly if you launch it from the command line (DOS).  Always launch by double clicking the exe or a shortcut to it.
[*]Due to issue #1, no debug mode is available.  Some errors that happen will still be printed either to a "Wrye Bash.exe.txt" file, or to the "stdout/stderr" window that shows up with errors sometimes.
[*]There may be plenty more...just think of them as "undocumented features"[/list][*]If you think you've found an error in the WBSA, be sure to uninstall ALL python components and test it again first, to be sure we get an accurate report.  Having python installed can sometimes trick the WBSA into thinking that it has all of the files it requires, even if it really doesn't.[/list]

[b]Linking[/b]: If you'd like to link to Bash from somewhere else, please do!  But be sure to link to either [url="http://tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=22368"]TESNexus[/url] or [url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/oblivionworks/"]SourceForge[/url].  Don't link to the actual Bash zip file, since that changes fairly frequently.

[b]Latest Version[/b]:
=== 293 [27/6/2011] [PacificMorrowind,Lojack,myk002,valda] [rev 1280][spoiler][list]
[*] Bashed Patch:[list]
  [*] Bugs fixed (CBash):[list]
    [*] Filter mods that were incorrectly being treated as not mergeable are mergeable once again.
    [*] Bug with the NPC AI Packages patcher fixed (incorrectly detecting if OOO and the UOP were installed).
    [*] Bash will now propery report mergeable mods that have active non-mergeable dependant mods as not mergeable.
    [*] Hack added to make sure that OOO.esp is reported as non-mergeable.
    [*] Fix for mergeability detection for corrupted/unrecognized format mods (presume non-mergeable and warn if in debug mode but don't fail - which could prevent rebuilding of patch in CBash mode).
    [*] NPC Face data should properly be merged, vice overridden.
    [*] Fixed merging of QUST records from Filter mods.[/list]  [*] Tweak Assorted: Default Icons updated to skip records that should not have icons (stageless quests, non-playable clothing, armor, and items).
  [*] Added ability to import Bashed Patch config from CBash to Python and Python to CBash.
  [*] Added the ability to build a Python Bashed Patch when CBash is active.  This now requires that a Python based [[#|Mark Mergeable]] to be automatically executed before rebuilding.[list]
    [*] No more renaming CBash.dll![/list]  [*] 'Revert to Saved' option, to restore the settings last used to build the Bashed Patch.[/list][*] Bugs fixed (General):[list]
  [*] Fixed multiple issues dealing with '&' (ampersand) in filenames.
  [*] BOSS's dirty edit CRC's will be properly read from the masterlist now.
  [*] Updated format of forum-postable text copied to clipboard (e.g. "List mods" output) so that the title appears ouside of the spoiler tag as requested by speedyg869 [url=http://forums.bethsoft.com/index.php?app=forums&module=forums&section=findpost&pid=17975809]here[/url]
  [*] Fixed the launching of OBSE when a Steam install is detected.[/list][*] Updated NSIS installer.
[*] Unicode Mode:[list]
  [*] Bugs fixed:[list]
    [*] debug printing failing of an error in reading a mod failing with some unicode mods.
    [*] Rename Player
    [*] Rename Save items (including Enchanted, Potions, Spells)[/list][/list][*] Startup:[list]
  [*] refactored cmdline opt getting
  [*] added/changed cmdline options:[list]
    [*] -d/--debug: no longer automatically disables Psyco import.
    [*] --no-psyco: disable Psyco import.
    [*] -C/--Cbash-mode: force cbash mode (requires CBash.dll to be named one of Rename_CBash.dll, CBash.dll or _CBash.dll).
    [*] -P/--Python-mode: force python mode (whether or not CBash.dll exists).
    [*] -U/--Unicode: equivalent to setting [b]bEnableUnicode[/b] to [i]True[/i] in bash.ini (but the cmdline options overide the ini when specified).
    [*] -A/--Ansi: equivalent to setting [b]bEnableUnicode[/b] to [i]False[/i] in bash.ini (but the cmdline options overide the ini when specified).
    [*] -i/--include-changed-images: includes changed images in mopy/images in backup/restore (if present in backup file) operation.
