Continuing from the [topic=insertOldTopicNumHere]previous thread[/topic]...

Wrye Bash is a multi-featured mod and savegame management tool for Oblivion written in the Python programming language.  Its primary purpose is to enable you to play your game with multiple mods that would not otherwise work well together (due to the way the mod system works, this is true for most mods that exist).

Its two best-known features are the Bashed Patch, which allows you to enable multiple overlapping mod plugins and have them work together sensibly, and the BAIN installation framework, an easy-to-use interface for installing and uninstalling mods that automatically heals your game data when multiple mods try to install the same files.  Related to and beyond these, it also has many capabilities targeted at mod creators and power users.

[b]FAQ of the day[/b]: What is CBash?
CBash is an elder scrolls master (.esm) and elder scrolls plugin (.esp) file parser.  It is written in C, and allows us to build Bashed Patches much faster on most systems than the original Python code.  Moreover, CBash parses more types of records than the Python code does, since parsing those records in Python would be prohibitively slow.  The practical benefits of using CBash are:
[list=1]
[*] Building the bashed patch is much faster
[*] More plugins are mergeable, giving you the ability to cram more goodness into Oblivion
[*] In the future, more interesting kinds of tweaks will be practical to implement
[/list][b]At this stage CBash still has a few bugs, though, and is in BETA.[/b]

[b]Requirements and Installation[/b]: Short version: just use the installer and install to the Oblivion folder!   When you install dependencies, just install them to their default locations.
Long version:[spoiler]There are two versions available: the Python version and the Standalone version.  They are functionally equivalent.  Most people should run the Standalone version since it is slightly simpler (no external Python components to install).  You should to install the Python version, however, if you want to be more involved with development or if you already have Python installed on your system for other reasons.

If you're using the Standalone version, the only thing you need to install manually is the [url=http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/confirmation.aspx?familyid=ba9257ca-337f-4b40-8c14-157cfdffee4e&displaylang=en]MSVC++ 2008 Redistributable[/url].

If you are using the Python version, dependency installation will be handled automatically by the installer.  However, if you want or need to do things manually:[spoiler][list]
  [*]Included in Wrye Python 04a:[list]
    [*][url=http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.1/python-2.7.1.msi]Python 2.7.1[/url] (Python 2.7.2 is fine as well, it's just not in Wrye Python yet)

  [*]Python 3.x: [b][u]NOT Supported[/u][/b]
[/list]Note that the 32-bit versions are required even if you are on a 64-bit operating system[/spoiler]
Then:[list]
  [*]For manual installations of either the Standalone or Python versions, extract the archive in your Oblivion game folder so that the Mopy directory appears in the Oblivion directory
  [*]For Python versions, run by double-clicking on Wrye Bash Launcher.pyw
  [*]For WBSA (Wrye Bash StandAlone), run by double-clicking on Wrye Bash.exe
[/list][/spoiler]Remember! In Windows Vista and up, don't install Oblivion in the Program Files folder due to User Access Controls!

[b]Development[/b]:
The project is hosted at [url=https://sourceforge.net/projects/oblivionworks/develop]SourceForge[/url].  You don't need a SourceForge account to create or add data to bug reports and feature requests -- you can always contribute anonymously (but put your name in the comments section if you want credit : ).  Feeling brave?  SVN versions are not guaranteed to be release quality, but if you know what you're doing and want to help us test new features and track down bugs, follow alt3rn1ty's SVN guide to use the latest code:
[spoiler]If going from Standalone version to Python version, use the latest installer to install the Python version before continuing.  It will install all required dependencies for you.

The latest svn is always here >>[url=http://oblivionworks.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/oblivionworks/Programs/Wrye%20Bash/]Click and Bookmark it[/url]<< - Then just click "Download GNU Tarball" at the bottom.  Note: If you have been told to try a specific revision number instead of the latest, type the revision number in the sticky revision box and press return, the Download GNU Tarball will now grab that revision's set of files.

Use >>[url=http://oblivionworks.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/oblivionworks/Programs/Wrye%20Bash/?view=log]this link[/url]<< to view the log of changes for reference to specific revision numbers and their changes, to revert to as necessary if things go wrong...

Rinse and repeat when a new svn comes out.

[b]Beware:[/b] Its a good idea to rename the tarball according to the revision number and keep it around.  Keep a few weeks worth of them so if there is a problem found later with a particular set of committed files in the tarball you can go back to a previous known good revision.  There's no need to go back this far but note svn revision 1309 was the directory structure change, and if you go back to a revision earlier than that you will probably have to follow [url=http://forums.bethsoft.com/index.php?/topic/1205502-relz-wrye-bash/page__view__findpost__p__18000658]this post[/url] to get WB running again.[/spoiler]
[b]Reporting Bugs[/b]: Try to give us enough information to diagnose your problem.  The following information is useful to us:[spoiler][list]
[*]What version of Wrye Bash are you using?  If you're using the SVN, be sure to include the revision number.
[*]What are all the symptoms?  Be sure to include what you did (step-by-step is helpful), what you expected, and what happened.
[*]What do you see?  Error messages are very valuable to us.
[*]What version of Windows are you using?  Is UAC enabled and is Oblivion in the default directory? (If it is, please install it somewhere else.  This can cause lots of problems)
[*]Are you using a bash.ini?  If so, include its contents (in spoiler tags, please!)
[*]Is the problem related to the Bashed Patch?  If so include the following:[list]
 [*]Your Load Order (in spoiler tags).  Get this by right clicking on a column header in the Mods tab, and selecting 'List Mods...'
 [*]Your Bashed Tags (in spoiler tags).  Get this by right clicking on a column header in the Mods tab, and selecting 'List Bash Tags...'
 [*]Your Bashed Patch config (in spoiler tags).  Get this by right clicking on the Bashed Patch and selecting 'List Patch Config...'[/list][*]If you're using the WBSA, things are a bit trickier.  There are currently a few known issues:[list=1]
[*]Wrye Bash wont work correctly if you launch it from the command line (DOS).  Always launch by double clicking the exe or a shortcut to it.
[*]Due to issue #1, no debug mode is available.  Some errors that happen will still be printed either to a "Wrye Bash.exe.txt" file, or to the "stdout/stderr" window that shows up with errors sometimes.[/list][*]If you think you've found an error in the WBSA, be sure to uninstall ALL python components and test it again first, to be sure we get an accurate report.  Having python installed can sometimes trick the WBSA into thinking that it has all of the files it requires, even if it really doesn't.[/list][/spoiler]
[b]Linking[/b]: If you'd like to link to Bash from somewhere else, please do!  But be sure to link to either [url=http://tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=22368]TESNexus[/url] or [url=http://sourceforge.net/projects/oblivionworks/]SourceForge[/url].  Don't link to the actual download file, since that changes fairly frequently.
