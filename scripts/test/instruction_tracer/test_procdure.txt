Test procedure for narrowing down cause of Bug 3329021: just opening Wrye Bash
causes Oblivion to CTD
http://sourceforge.net/support/tracker.php?aid=3329021

Test setup:
[list=1]
[*]Download [url=http://tesalliance.org/forums/index.php?/files/download/997-multiple-oblivion-manager-mom/]MOM 1.0.1[/url]
[*]Decompress MOM 1.0.1.7z somewhere, like your desktop
[*]Read "Multiple Oblivion Manager ReadMe.doc" to get the basics on how it works
[*]Run "Multiple Oblivion Manager.exe"
[*][b]Import[/b] your current working install that has Wrye Bash 291.1 installed in it; call it "safe working version" or something
[*]Go into [b]Settings[/b] and uncheck "Oblivion Mods" (you don't need to copy your BAIN installers for this test)
[*]Click [b]New[/b] and clone the safe working version.  call it "test snapshot"
[*][b]Swap[/b] to "test snapshot"
[*]With "test snapshot" as your active clone, install ([b]but do not run[/b]) [url="http://tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=22368"]Wrye Bash 294.2[/url].  Install the Python version, not the standalone.
[*]Download wbtest.7z and extract it in the directory [b]above[/b] Oblivion.  For example, if Oblivion is installed in c:/Games/Oblivion, extract the archive in c:/Games.  It will extract the following directories and files:
[list]
[*]Oblivion/Mopy/Wyre Bash Launcher.pyw (you might get prompted for permission to overwrite this file -- allow it)
[*]wbtest/wbtest.bat
[*]wbtest/wbtest.py
[/list]
[*]Make sure the "wbtest" directory got created at the same level as "Oblivion". If your Oblivion directory is not called "Oblivion", tell me and I'll tweak the test a bit to get it to work for you.
[*]Click [b]New[/b] in MOM again and clone "test snapshot".  call it "test"
[*][b]Swap[/b] to "test" to make it the active clone
[/list]
Leave MOM running throughout the test.  Now with "test" as your active clone, run wbtest.bat.  Do not run wbtest.py directly or the output from the test will be lost.  The test app will come up.  The test tool will walk you through what to do.  It will start Wyre Bash and Oblivion for you.  There is no need to run them yourself from this point forward.  If the test gets interrupted for some reason (windows forces you to reboot because of an automatically applied update, for example), you can use the slider in the test tool to continue from where you left off, but hopefully that won't happen, so to save space I won't go into details for how to do that here.

Whenever the test tool gets Oblivion to crash, follow these steps in MOM before starting the next test iteration:
[list=1]
[*][b]Swap[/b] to "test snapshot" to make it your active clone
[*][b]Delete[/b] the "test" clone
[*]Click [b]New[/b] and create a new "test" clone
[*][b]Swap[/b] to "test" to make it your active clone
[/list]

When the test is over, or if things go horribly wrong, or you get tired of testing (whichever comes first), you can always make "safe working version" your active clone and play normally.  The full test takes 20 iterations, though hopefully you won't have to restore the test clone more than a few times.  When you're done, please upload the wbtest/BashBugDump.log file so I can take a look at it.
