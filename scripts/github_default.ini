# If you run into GitHub's rate limit, create a personal access token:
# https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token
# Make sure it has 'repo' scope, then read on below.
# You may also want to consider using a fine-grained token instead and giving
# it only the permissions you need it to have (i.e. read-only access).
#
# **DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE!** Instead, make a copy called 'github.ini' and edit
# that. The .gitignore is set up to ignore github.ini, but not changes to this
# 'default' file.
#
# **NEVER MAKE YOUR TOKEN PUBLIC!** It will give anyone who has it access to *all*
# repos you have access to.
