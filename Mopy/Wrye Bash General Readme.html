<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
<p>Wrye Bash is a powerful mod management utility for TES IV: Oblivion and TES V: Skyrim. Its features include:
<ul>
	<li>A mod installation and conflict manager
	<li>A plugin load order manager
	<li>Increased mod compatibility
	<li>Lifting of the 255 plugin limit through automatic merging of compatible mods
	<li>.ini and settings files tweak management
	<li>Screenshot management
	<li>Many, many more features
</ul>
<p>Wrye Bash can appear daunting at first. To help make it more manageable, the documentation has been split into a few readmes that are targeted towards different usage requirements.
<p>This readme covers only the most commonly used features, so that the average user can start using Wrye Bash without being overwhelmed. Information on the less commonly used features and more technical details of the features covered in this readme may be found in the <a href="Wrye%20Bash%20Advanced%20Readme.html">Advanced Readme</a>. Information on some of the syntaxes and file formats that Wrye Bash uses are found in the <a href="Wrye%20Bash%20Technical%20Readme.html">Technical Readme</a>. Finally, Wrye Bash's version history is stored in the <a href="Wrye%20Bash%20Version%20History.html">Version History</a> document. There is also a summary of the contents of the Advanced Readme near the end of this readme.

<h3 id="intro-glossary">Glossary</h3>
<p>Modding for Oblivion and Skyrim has a wonderful history of confusing terminology. The list below details some terms commonly used when dealing with mods.
<ul>
	<li><b>The game</b> is the game that Wrye Bash is running for, either Oblivion or Skyrim.
	<li><b>CTD</b> is an acronym for Crash To Desktop. Used to describe the game crashing.
	<li><b>DLC</b> refers to any of the official downloadable content for the game.
	<li><b>Mod</b> refers to any unofficial user-made modification to the game.
	<li><b>Mod author</b> refers to a person that makes modifications to the game. It can also refer to those who are involved in the creation of utilities that are used by mod authors and/or users.
	<li><b>ESP</b> (case-insensitive) refers to any file with a <code>.esp</code> extension. It is an acronym for Elder Scrolls Plugin.
	<li><b>ESM</b> (case-insensitive) refers to any file with a <code>.esm</code> extension. It is an acronym for Elder Scrolls Master.
	<li><b>Plugin</b> refers to any ESP <u>or</u> ESM file.
	<li><b>Master</b> refers to any plugins that another plugin is dependent on to function. (It can also refer to an ESM file, as it used to be that only ESMs could be masters, until mod authors developed methods of using ESP files as masters too. The latter definition will not be used in this documentation.)
	<li><b>The game's master file</b> refers to the ESM that must be loaded for the game to function. For Oblivion, this is <code>Oblivion.esm</code>, and for Skyrim this is <code>Skyrim.esm</code>.
	<li><b>Conflicts</b> occur when two different mods try to change the same game variable or resource, which could be anything from a specific object in game to a script or a texture. Conflicts can cause problems, including CTDs or save game corruption, but they are not inherently bad, and most modding is the result of purposeful conflicts.
	<li><b>Resource Conflicts</b> occur when two mods contain two different files that go in the same place, so one mod's file overwrites the others's file. This type of conflict can be managed by altering the install order of mods.
	<li><b>Data Conflicts</b> occur when two mod plugins alter the same game data. This type of conflict can be managed by altering the load order of plugins.
	<li><b>BSAs</b> are Bethesda Softwork Archives, with <code>.bsa</code> file extensions. They can be used to store resource files such as textures and meshes.
	<li><b>ITMs</b> are Identical To Master records, ie. data in a plugin for something that is identical to the data for that thing in the plugin's master(s). Usually a type of unintended edit, known as a <q>dirty edit</q>, which can break the functionality of other mods that require the record in question to have a specific value, but which have that value overriden by an ITM record.
	<li><b>UDRs</b> are Undeleted and Disabled References. Deleted References can cause crashing, and this can be avoided by first undeleting and then disabling them instead. A type of <q>dirty edit</q>. This acronym is generally misused - the UDR acronym is frequently used to refer to the deleted references, rather than their fixed counterparts. For example, <q>Scan For UDRs</q> will scan for deleted references, not undeleted and disabled references, and BOSS will report the UDR count for a plugin, which is actually the number of deleted references that can be fixed.
</ul>
<p>This readme will also use the placeholder <b>[Game]</b>. Replace this with <q>Oblivion</q> or <q>Skyrim</q> depending on which game Wrye Bash is running for. Additional terminology specific to Wrye Bash's functions will be introduced as required. Also, links that are followed by <img src='data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAoAAAAKCAYAAACNMs+9AAAAVklEQVR4Xn3PgQkAMQhDUXfqTu7kTtkpd5RA8AInfArtQ2iRXFWT2QedAfttj2FsPIOE1eCOlEuoWWjgzYaB/IkeGOrxXhqB+uA9Bfcm0lAZuh+YIeAD+cAqSz4kCMUAAAAASUVORK5CYII='/> go to pages that are not part of the Wrye Bash documentation.

<h3 id="intro-title">Title Bar Info</h3>
<p>As a quick note that doesn't really belong anywhere else, Wrye Bash's title bar contains some useful information. The title is formatted as:
<p><code>Wrye Bash [Bash Version] [Install Type] [Game Modifier], Cbash v[CBash Version]: [Save Profile] [Version Indicator]</code>
<p>The square bracketed information is:
<ul>
	<li><code>[Bash Version]</code>: This is the version number for the version of Wrye Bash running. Useful when troubleshooting.
	<li><code>[Install Type]</code>: If the Python version is running, this will read <q>Python</q>. If the Standalone version is running, it will read <q>(Standalone)</q>. See the <a href="#install">Installation</a> section for more information.
	<li><code>[Game Modifier]</code>: If the option is selected in the <a href="Wrye%20Bash%20Advanced%20Readme.html#tools-settings">Settings menu</a>, this will display <q>for Oblivion</q> or <q>for Skyrim</q> depending on the game it is being run for.
	<li><code>[CBash Version]</code>: This is the version number for the version of CBash included with the Wrye Bash install. Useful when troubleshooting. See the <a href="#patch">Setting Up A Bashed Patch</a> section for more information.
	<li><code>[Save Profile]</code>: This is the name of the <a href="Wrye%20Bash%20Advanced%20Readme.html#saves-profile">save profile</a> Wrye Bash is currently using. By default it is <q>Default</q>.
	<li><code>[Version Indicator]</code>: This is only displayed when Wrye Bash is running for Oblivion. It indicates the version of Oblivion.esm currently being used. This is related to the <a href="Wrye%20Bash%20Advanced%20Readme.html#tools-swapping">Oblivion.esm Swapping</a> feature.
</ul>

<h2 id="install">Installation</h2>
<p>The simplest way to install Wrye Bash is using the installer. The installer will handle the installation of Wrye Bash's dependencies and Wrye Bash itself automatically. However, the instructions below are provided if a manual install method is preferred.
<p><b>Note:</b> There are two versions of Wrye Bash available: the Python version and the Standalone version. Both are the same program, but the Standalone version has fewer dependencies and so is recommended for most people. The Python version requires the installation of some Python libraries, and the Standalone version requires the installation of the MSVC++ 2008 Redistributable.
<p><b>Windows Vista &amp; Windows 7 users:</b> Windows' User Account Control feature may interfere with the running of Wrye Bash and other utilities. See the <a href="#trouble-permissions">File Permissions</a> section for solutions.
<p>Manual Standalone Version Install:
<ol>
	<li>Download and install the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=a5c84275-3b97-4ab7-a40d-3802b2af5fc2">MSVC++ 2008 Redistributable</a>.
	<li>Extract the downloaded Wrye Bash archive into the game folder (<q>Oblivion</q> or <q>skyrim</q> depending on the game) so that the Mopy directory appears in the game folder.
	<li>Run Wrye Bash by double-clicking <q>Wrye Bash.exe</q> in the new Mopy folder.
</ol>
<p>Manual Python Version Install:
<ol>
	<li>Download and install the Wrye Python package from the location Wrye Bash was downloaded from. This package contains all the required Python libraries. If you have previously installed Python and any Python libraries, or the Wrye Python package itself, you may not need to install it again. See the <a href="Wrye%20Bash%20Advanced%20Readme.html#install">Advanced Installation</a> section for the list of included libraries and their versions to check if you need to install any of the libraries bundled in the Wrye Python package.
	<li>Extract the downloaded Wrye Bash archive into your game folder (<q>Oblivion</q> or <q>skyrim</q> depending on the game) so that the Mopy directory appears in your game folder.
	<li>Run Wrye Bash by double-clicking <q>Wrye Bash Launcher.pyw</q> in the new Mopy folder.
</ol>

<h2 id="uninstall">Uninstallation</h2>
<p>The ease with which Wrye Bash can be removed is dependent on how much you use it to manage your modded game. 
<ul>
	<li>If you use a Bashed Patch, you will need to remove any dependencies on it from your saves before uninstalling Wrye Bash in order to avoid in-game issues. This may be near-impossible to do, depending on what is in your Bashed Patch.
	<li>If you use BAIN to manage your installed mods, you will need to ensure that you have an adequate alternative management system ready, as although uninstalling Wrye Bash will not uninstall your mods, you will no longer be able to use BAIN's conflict resolution features.
	<li>If you use any INI tweaks applied through Wrye Bash, you will need to make a note of which tweaks you have applied, as although uninstalling Wrye Bash will not undo your tweaks, you will no longer have any record of tweaks applied or default values.
	<li>If you use the People tab, you will need to transfer your notes on people and record their karma outside of Wrye Bash.
	<li>If you use the PM Archive tab, you will need to move your archived PMs outside of Wrye Bash's folders.
</ul>
<p>If none of the above points apply to you, or once you have taken the necessary measures for the points that apply, you can uninstall Wrye Bash by either running the uninstaller, if you used the installer to install Wrye Bash, or delete the following files and folders if you installed it manually.
<ul>
	<li><code>[Game]\Mopy</code> - If you've edited any localisation files in the <code>l10n</code> folder that you want to keep, back them up.
	<li><code>[Game]\Data\Bash Patches</code> - If you've exported any CSV files that you want to keep, back them up.
	<li><code>[Game]\Data\Docs</code>
	<li><code>[Game]\Data\INI Tweaks</code>
	<li><code>Documents\My Games\[Game]</code> - Only delete the <code>BashProfiles.dat</code>, <code>BashProfiles.dat.bak</code>, <code>BashSettings.dat</code>, <code>BashSettings.dat.bak</code>, <code>Messages.dat</code>, <code>Messages.dat.bak</code>, <code>People.dat</code> and <code>People.dat.bak</code> files and the <code>Saves\Bash</code> folder.
	<li><code>[Game] Mods</code> (in the same folder as [Game]) - The <code>Bash Installers</code> folder stores the mods you've installed via BAIN.
</ul>

</figure>
<h3 id="bain-overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Wrye Bash's mod installer is known as <abbr title="Bash Installers">BAIN</abbr>, and is represented by the Installers tab. The first time the Installers tab is opened, a dialog will appear asking if BAIN should be initialized. If you click <q>Yes</q>, BAIN will be initialised, which can take some time. After that, the information refresh performed when the Installers tab is opened is much faster. BAIN's primary function is to install mod packages. <b>BAIN Packages</b> can be .zip, .7z or .rar archives or uncompressed directories. Uncompressed directories are called <b>Projects</b>.
<p>If BAIN is disabled, ie. if you clicked <q>No</q> on the dialog that was displayed the first time you selected the Installers tab, it can be re-enabled by right clicking on a column header in the Installers tab and selecting <a href="Wrye%20Bash%20Advanced%20Readme.html#bainEnabled">Enabled</a>.

<h3 id="bain-convert">Restructuring Packages to be BAIN-Compatible</h3>
<p>The easiest way to tell if a package needs manual converting to be compatible with BAIN is to try installing it. If it is listed in the Package list with a grey checkbox and name, then BAIN cannot install it. Due to BAIN's flexibility, many mods are already packaged in ways that are compatible, but for those that are not, there are a few possible cases:
<ul>
	<li>The mod has a <abbr title="BAIN Conversion File">BCF</abbr>. BCFs are special packages that tell BAIN how to restructure the mod to be compatible with BAIN without the user having to do any work.
	<li>The mod is distributed as an OMOD (ie. has file extension <code>.omod</code>). These mods are intended for installation with the Oblivion Mod Manager or Nexus Mod Manager. Such mods usually have a non-OMOD download option: if one is available, download that instead as it is more likely to be compatible. Otherwise, OMOD files can be converted to Projects automatically by dragging and dropping them into the Installers tab.
	<li>The mod is distributed as an archive, or is a converted OMOD Project, but doesn't have a folder structure that BAIN recognises. It will need manual restructuring.
	<li>The mod is distributed as an executable (ie. has file extension <code>.exe</code>). This is very rare, as mods do not require the complexity of executables, and the greater security risk executables represent makes their use unpopular. BAIN cannot install mods distributed in this way: often the only way to install them is to run the executable. You can often run the installer, installing to a dummy folder, and then repack the <q>installed</q> files into a BAIN-compatible format.
</ul>
<p>If an archive has a BCF, it can be converted for installation with BAIN using the following instructions.
<ol>
	<li>Ensure that the BCF is installed in the correct location, <code>[Game] Mods\Bash Installers\Bain Converters</code>. Also ensure that the archive(s) it converts is/are in <code>[Game] Mods\Bash Installers</code>.
	<li>From the BAIN installers list, select the archive(s) to be converted (i.e., the <q>source</q> packages) and right click on the selected file(s) to bring up the context menu, and select <a href="#bainConversions">Conversions</a> to open the sub-menu.
	<li>Click on <a href="#bainApply">Apply</a> to open a second sub-menu and select the BCF from it. There may be more than one BCF listed if multiple installed BCFs can convert the selected package(s). An asterisk ('*') is added to the end of a BCF's name for every archive it converts that isn't selected.
	<li>Optionally choose a name for the converted archive(s).
	<li>Once Wrye Bash has finished the conversion, the converted archive(s) will appear in the BAIN package list ready for install. You can now delete the original archive(s).
</ol>
<p>If a package is unrecognised by BAIN and has no associated BCF, its contents will have to be rearranged so that the structure matches one of the three types of BAIN-compatible package structures:
<table>
	<thead><tr><th>Structure<th>Description
	<tbody>
		<tr><td>Simple<td>Package has .esp, .esm and/or .bsa files, and/or any of the regular game subdirectories (screenshots, bash patches, distantlod, docs, facegen, fonts, menus, meshes, music, shaders, sound, textures, trees, video, streamline, _tejon, ini tweaks, scripts, pluggy, ini, obse) at the top level of the package.
		<tr><td>Complex<td>Package has top-level subdirectories that each have a simple structure (as defined above). Each top-level subdirectory will be treated as a sub-package, and can be independently activated or deactivated as desired.
		<tr><td>Complex/Simple<td>A complex package with only one top-level subdirectory. It is treated as a simple package. Examples include mods packaged with a top-level Data directory.
</table>

<h3 id="bain-install">Installing/Uninstalling Via BAIN</h3>
<p>Packages must first be placed in the <code>[Game] Mods\Bash Installers</code> directory. This can either be done via Windows Explorer, or by dragging and dropping the package into the Wrye Bash window when the Installers tab is open. If you drag and drop, you will be asked whether you want to copy the package or move it.
<p>If a package contains a Wizard (ie. there is <img src="bash/images/wizard.png" alt="a wand icon"/> overlaid on its checkbox):
<ol>
	<li>Right-click the package and select <a href="#bainWizard">Wizard</a>. You can also choose to install using the Wizard's default options by selecting <a href="#bainAutoWizard">Auto Wizard</a>.
	<li>If you chose <a href="#bainWizard">Wizard</a>, navigate through the steps of the Wizard to install the package. Otherwise, you will be skipped to the Wizard finish screen.
	<li>At the Wizard's finish screen, click the <q>Apply</q> button to apply its selections. The Wizard window may need to be resized for the <q>Apply</q> button to become visible.
</ol>
<p>If a package has a Simple or a Complex/Simple structure:
<ol>
	<li>Select the package in the package list.
	<li>Choose which plugins to install from it using the <q>Esp/m Filter</q> box to the far right of the package list. Checked plugins will be installed, while unchecked plugins will be skipped.
	<li>Right-click the package and select <a href="#bainInstall">Install</a>.
</ol>
<p>If a package has a Complex structure:
<ol>
	<li>Select the package in the package list.
	<li>Choose which sub-packages to install from the <q>Sub-Package</q> box to the right of the package list. Checked sub-packages will be installed, while unchecked sub-packages will be skipped.
	<li>Choose which plugins to install from it using the <q>Esp/m Filter</q> box to the far right of the package list. Checked plugins will be installed, while unchecked plugins will be skipped.
	<li>Right-click the package and select <a href="#bainInstall">Install</a>.
</ol>
<p>If you install a package then later change the sub-packages or esp/m files selected, you can apply these changed by right-clicking the package in the list and selecting <a href="#bainAnneal">Anneal</a>. A Wizard provides a scripted installation method that can be useful for more complex mods with many options.
<p>When a package is installed, BAIN installs any files that appear to be documentation into the <code>Data\Docs</code> folder. Any files that are simply named <q>readme</q> (eg. readme.txt, readme.html, readme.doc) will be renamed according to the package name to prevent packages overwriting each other's readmes.
<p>To uninstall any package, simply right-click the package in the package list and select <a href="#bainUninstall">Uninstall</a>. You can also uninstall packages that BAIN hasn't installed, which will remove any installed files that match the ones in the package. This is useful for cleaning out mods that were manually installed. Uninstalling via BAIN respects the ownership of files, ie. uninstalling a mod that contains files also installed by a mod listed lower down will not uninstall the lower mod's files. See the next section, <a href="#bain-order">BAIN Package Order</a> for more on this. If the <a href="Wrye%20Bash%20Advanced%20Readme.html#bainAutoAnneal">Auto-Anneal</a> option is enabled (the default), then files from other packages previously overriden by the uninstalled package's files will be automatically restored.

<h3 id="bain-order">BAIN Package Order</h3>
<p>The install order of packages in BAIN is important as this decides which mod gets its files installed in the case of resource conflicts. Packages may be listed in install order by left-clicking on the <q>Order</q> column header. If two mods try to install the same file, then the mod lower down in the list will have its file overwrite the file of the mod higher up in the list.
<p>The order of sub-packages within a package follow the same rules as packages. Checked sub-packages lower in the sub-package list will overwrite conflicting content from sub-packages above them.
<p>Package conflicts are detailed in the <q>Conflicts</q> tab to the right of the package list when you select a package. This tab tells you which packages have which files that conflict with files in your currently-selected package. It gives this information for packages both above and below the selected package in the package list.
<p>BAIN allows you to easily adjust the conflict status of packages by moving their order around. This can be done by dragging and dropping packages within the list, or by right-clicking packages and selecting the <a href="#bainMoveTo">Move To...</a> option. You can also select multiple packages and move them, in which case they will be moved as a group, retaining their order relative to one another in their new location. A third option is to select the package(s) and use Ctrl-Up or Ctrl-Down to move them up or down respectively.

<h3 id="bain-symbols">What Symbols &amp; Colours Mean</h3>
<p>BAIN uses the colours of packages in the package list and the state of their checkboxes to convey information about their status to the user. A checkbox state may be combined with any checkbox or text colour, and the possible states and colours are described in the tables below.
<p><b>Note:</b> Installed packages are marked with a plus, eg. <img src="bash/images/checkbox_green_inc.png" width="16" height="16" alt="+"/>. Corrupt or incomplete packages are marked with a cross, eg. <img src="bash/images/checkbox_red_x.png" width="16" height="16" alt="a cross"/>. Packages that begin and end with <q>==</q>, eg. <q>==Last==</q>, are marker packages. They don't represent an archive or folder and so contain no files, but may be used to organise the package list.
<table>
	<thead><tr><th>Checkbox Shape<th>Meaning
	<tbody>
		<tr><td><img src="bash/images/diamond_white_off.png" width="16" height="16" alt="diamond"/><td>The package is a Project, ie. a directory rather than an archive.
		<tr><td><img src="bash/images/checkbox_white_off.png" width="16" height="16" alt="checkbox"/><td>The package is an archive.

<h2 id="load">Setting Up Load Order</h2>
<figure>
<img src="bash/images/Mods-1.png" alt="Mods Tab"/>
<figcaption>Wrye Bash's Mods tab.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="load-overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Wrye Bash displays your installed plugins in its <q>Mods</q> tab. Your load order consists of active installed plugins, which Wrye Bash marks with a ticked checkbox. The load order is important as it decides what plugin 'wins' any conflict between plugins, with later loading plugins overriding those that change the same thing. <b>Load order is not the same thing as install order!</b> Install order determines which mods' files overwrite other mods' files when they conflict. Load order determines which plugins' effects override other plugins' effects in-game when they conflict.
<p>Plugins may be activated by clicking their checkbox so that the checkbox is ticked, or by selecting a plugin or group of plugins and pressing the space bar on your keyboard. Plugins may be deactivated by again clicking their checkbox or pressing the spacebar. If a group of selected plugins contains a mix of active and inactive plugins, pressing the space bar once will activate them all, thereafter it will function as normal.
<p>Some plugins are explicitly dependent on other plugins - they have these plugins as <q>masters</q>. When a plugin is activated, its masters are also activated. Conversely, when a plugin upon which other plugins depend is deactivated, those plugins are also deactivated.</p>
<p>When setting the load order, make sure that Wrye Bash is displaying your plugins sorted by Load Order. Do so by clicking on the <q>Load Order</q> column header near the top of the tab. You can also display the plugins sorted by other attributes by clicking on any of the other column headers. Clicking twice will reverse the display order for any column but Load Order. The load order of plugins is given in hexadecimal digits, from 00 to FF, which is 0 to 255 in decimal. (This number also forms the first two digits of a record's Form ID.)
<p>Note that you can only have a maximum of 255 plugins, not including your game's master file (eg. Oblivion.esm, Skyrim.esm), active at any one time. Wrye Bash displays a plugin count in its status bar, to the right hand side, in the format <code>Mods: [active]/[installed]</code>.

<h3 id="load-set">Setting The Load Order</h3>
<p>The load order of plugins is decided by their relative modification dates, with the exception that .esm plugins always load before all the .esp plugins.
<p>Setting up a correct load order that minimises detrimental conflicts that could cause issues in-game can be a difficult and time-consuming process. Effective load-ordering often requires a knowledge of what each plugin in your load order contains so that you can position the plugins to minimise these conflicts. For simple mods, the description in the mod's readme will usually be sufficient to determine the records it contains, but to be sure a utility such as TES4Edit is required.
<p><a href="http://tes.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=20516">BOSS</a> can be used to greatly simplify the process of setting the load order, as it can correctly position thousands of plugins automatically. However, if you use any plugins it does not recognise, you will still need to order them manually.
<p>Wrye Bash provides a number of ways for you to set up your load order:
<ul>
	<li><i>Oblivion only.</i> Editing plugin modification dates in the right-hand details panel.
	<li>Alphabetical sorting by selecting a group of plugins and choosing File->Sort from the right-click menu.
	<li>Moving plugins up or down the load order by selecting them and using Ctrl-Up or Ctrl-Down respectively. This also works with groups of plugins and preserves the group's internal order.
	<li><i>Oblivion only.</i> Selecting a group of plugins and choosing File->Redate from the right-click menu. This will move the first plugin to the specified date/time and position the others at one minute intervals after it.
	<li>Dragging and dropping plugins will also change the load order if the plugins are being sorted by Load Order.
</ul>
<p>You can also lock your load order in place to prevent unintended changes to it by selecting the <a href="modsLockLoadOrder">Lock Load Order</a> option in the column header right-click menu. Note that this will prevent other utilities from changing the load order, so uncheck this option if you use such a utility to set your load order. If you use BOSS to manage your load order and you also use Lock Load Order, ensure <a href="modsBOSSDisableLockLoadOrder">BOSS Disable Lock Load Order</a> is also enabled to allow BOSS to function correctly.

<h3 id="load-symbols">What Symbols &amp; Colours Mean</h3>
<p>Like in the Installers tab, Wrye Bash uses colour-coding and other formatting effects to convey information about the state of plugins. The different types of formatting used and their meanings are explained here.

		<tr><td><img src="bash/images/checkbox_orange_on.png" width="16" height="16" alt="Orange" /><td>Some of the plugin's masters are in a different order than what is specified in the plugin. This will generally be handled automatically by the game, but it may result in changes in-game.

		<tr><td colspan="2" id="modsListBashTags">List Bash Tags<td>This lists all the Bash Tags applied to the plugins in your load order, and where/how the Bash Tags were specified. It can be useful for debugging a broken load order.
		<tr><td colspan="2" id="modsAutoGhost">Auto-Ghost<td>The game engine has a bug where it reads all the plugins in the Data folder, and this can affect performance when the number of plugins is around 300+. Auto-Ghosting adds a <q>.ghost</q> extension to all inactive plugins automatically to prevent the game engine reading them, and so helping to avoid the performance drop. When a ghosted plugin is activated, the <q>.ghost</q> extension is removed, allowing it to function as normal. Note that most other utilities will not recognise ghosted plugins, so there are options available for individual plugins to control which get ghosted.
		<tr><td colspan="2" id="modsLockLoadOrder">Lock Load Order<td>This prevents other utilities from altering plugin load order. More accurately, it detects changes to load order when Wrye Bash is focussed (ie. on top of all other program windows) and reverses those changes.

<figcaption style="padding-top:620px;">Wrye Bash's Bashed Patch configuration dialog.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="patch-overview">Overview</h3>
<p>A Bashed Patch is a configurable plugin with three main functions:
<ul>
	<li>Merging plugins into itself. Merged plugins can be deactivated, avoiding the 255 plugin limit.
	<li>Importing specific types of data records from plugins. This can be used to avoid compatibility issues.
	<li>Applying tweaks to the game. This avoids the need to use other mods to apply the same tweaks.
</ul>
<p>A Bashed Patch is created by Wrye Bash the first time you run it, with the plugin being called <q><b>Bashed Patch, 0.esp</b></q>. It is configured using the plugin context menu commands <a href="#modsRebuildPatch">Rebuild Patch...</a> or <a href="modsRebuildPatchCBash">Rebuild Patch (CBash *Beta*)...</a>. <strong>You should rebuild your Bashed Patch every time you change your load order, before playing the game.</strong> The Bashed Patch should be last in your load order, unless you have plugins that explicitly state that they must load last.
<p>The configuration dialog consists of a list of major sections to the left, and the contents of the selected section to the right, with the build and save buttons at the bottom. The sections and their items have checkboxes: checking a section will include all its checked items in the Bashed Patch. Unchecked sections and items will not be included. Some sections don't have any items, and so just need the section checkbox checked. 
<p>A short description of each section and some items is displayed near the bottom of the window if the section/item is hovered over. Bolded items are new since the last time the Bashed Patch was built. Wrye Bash will try to auto-configure most sections, but some will still need tweaking.
<p><b>Note:</b> There are currently two methods of building a Bashed Patch. One uses Python, and the other uses CBash, which is a software library written to speed up the reading of plugins. Both methods offer the same options. The CBash method is faster and allows more types of plugin to be merged, but contains some bugs as CBash is still a work in progress. CBash will become the default in the near future, once its bugs have been fixed. For now, it is probably safer to use the Python method.

</table>

<h3 id="patch-merging">Merging Plugins</h3>
<p>Plugins that contain only certain types of data records can be merged into the Bashed Patch. This then allows these plugins to be deactivated, freeing up space in your load order.
<p>You should check the checkboxes of all the plugins listed in the <q>Merge Patches</q> section, and ensure the section is checked too. Once the Bashed Patch is built, these plugins can then be deactivated (Wrye Bash will ask to do this for you).
<p><b>Do not remove merged mods from your Data folder.</b> They will need to be present when you next rebuild your Bashed Patch.

<h3 id="patch-importing">Importing From Plugins</h3>
<p>Plugins can be tagged with Bash Tags that tell Wrye Bash that they contain certain changes that should be preserved even if another mod also changes the same things. This is usually because the changes are important to the functionality of the mod. Wrye Bash then allows you to choose which plugins should have which types of changes preserved, by selecting from the various Import sections when building a Bashed Patch.
<p>If a section's description in the table below begins with <q>Preserves</q> and two or more mods in its list change the same thing, then the later-loading plugin will override the other plugin(s). Otherwise changes are merged.

		<tr><td id="patchAliasModNames">Alias Mod Names<td>Allows Wrye Bash to recognise some common renamings of plugins that are referenced in .csv data files that it imports as part of some Bashed Patch sections. Renamings should be listed in the text box for this section. The format is <code>Old.esp => New.esp</code>.<td>If you have renamed a plugin that is referenced in a CSV file you have selected in the Bashed Patch's configuration. It is recommended that you refrain from renaming plugins, as it can break parts of Wrye Bash and other utilities.

		<tr><td id="patchPowerExhaustion">Power Exhaustion<td><i>Oblivion only.</i> This is an option provided for backwards-compatibility only and was deprecated then finally removed in Wrye Bash v296. Users of Power Exhaustion should upgrade to Cobl and use its Exhaustion feature instead.<td>Never.
		<tr><td id="patchRaceRecords">Race Records<td><i>Oblivion only.</i> Some mods make changes to races and want those changes to be preserved even if another mod changes the same race. This ensures that those changes are kept. It also checks for and fixes various errors such as googly eyes and missing hair or eyes. It also has a section of race tweaks which the user can select as desired.<td>Always, even if there are no mods listed on the right.
		<tr><td id="patchSEWorldTests">SEWorld Tests<td><i>Oblivion only.</i> Fixes quests that aren't suspended while your character is in the Shivering Isles. This doesn't apply to mod-added quests, it only restores suspension to vanilla quests where mods have removed it.<td>Always.

</figure>

<h3 id="ini-overview">Overview</h3>
<p>The Ini Edits tab allows the user to quickly apply edits to Oblivion.ini or Skyrim.ini, depending on your game, and mod-added ini files, including those containing scripts used to configure mods. Edits are applied from ini tweak files, which are just a text file that contains only the lines of the ini that you wish to change. Ini tweaks are stored in the <code>Data\Ini Tweaks</code> folder, and may be installed through BAIN or placed there manually. 
<p>The drop-down box allows you to select the current ini file. The <q>Browse...</q> option in the drop-down box can be used to select an ini file not listed.
<p>Selecting a tweak will display its contents in the middle column, and highlights the changes it applies to the current ini file in the right column. To apply a tweak, right click it and select <a href="#tweakApply">Apply</a>.
<p><b>Warning:</b> Incorrect Oblivion.ini or Skyrim.ini settings can cause bugs, CTDs or other damage to your game. Advanced settings in particular tend to be machine-specific and should not be casually copied from one computer to another.

<p>At the bottom left of Bash's main window you'll find launch buttons for your game and other applications if they're installed. You'll also find a few toggle buttons and some Wrye Bash feature buttons. Each of the application buttons will be present if the corresponding application is present in the game install directory, or in their default install location if the application is not game-specific.
<p>Clicking an application's icon will launch it, and clicking a toggle button will change the state of the toggle. Clicking a Wrye Bash feature button will open that feature's window.

The BOSS launcher has some options:
<ul>
	<li>If the option in the main menu is selected, it will automatically turn Lock Load Order off while running and then turn Lock Load Order back on.
	<li>If <b>V</b> is pressed, it will disable version parsing.
	<li>If <b>R</b> is pressed, it will do a level 1 revert (to the state just prior to the last sort).
	<li>If <b>Shift-R</b> is pressed, it will do a level 2 revert (to the state just prior to the 2nd last sort).
	<li>If <b>S</b> is pressed, it will run BOSS in its silent mode, so that the BOSS Log does not automatically open once it has finished running.
	<li>If <b>C</b> is pressed, it will run BOSS with its Display File CRCs option enabled, so that plugin CRCs are displayed in the BOSS Log.

<h2 id="trouble">Troubleshooting</h2>
<h3 id="trouble-dump">Generating A Bug Dump</h3>
<p>If Wrye Bash encounters an issue, it will generate a bug dump that will appear in a popup window. If an issue is encountered during startup, Wrye Bash may be unable to create the popup window, and so the bug dump will be saved to a log file, either <code>bash.log</code> or <code>Wrye Bash.exe.log</code> depending on the version of Wrye Bash you use. If no log file is present, then you will have to generate it yourself, using the steps below.
<ol>
	<li>Open a command prompt. This can be done by selecting Start->Programs->Accessories->Command Prompt.
	<li>Change the working directory to the <code>Mopy</code> directory. E.g. <code>cd /D "C:\Program Files\Bethesda Softworks\Oblivion\Mopy"</code> if Wrye Bash is installed for Oblivion.
	<li>If using the Python version of Wrye Bash: Run <code>"Wrye Bash Debug.py" -d > bash.log</code>.
	<ul>
		<li>If that does not work, try <code>"C:\python27\python.exe" "Wrye Bash Debug.py" -d</code>. This assumes that you have Python 2.7 installed to the default directory. Adjust the above to reference the correct path if not.
	</ul>
	If using the Standalone version of Wrye Bash: Run <code>"Wrye Bash.exe" -d</code>.
</ol>
<p>The log file will detail the cause of the problem that is stopping Wrye Bash from starting. Read it and the rest of this section to see if the problem is something you can fix yourself. If not, report it to an official Wrye Bash thread for support.

<h3 id="trouble-permissions">File Permissions</h3>
<p>If you are running Windows Vista or Windows 7, Wrye Bash (and other modding programs) may be prevented from working correctly by the UAC security feature. There are four common workarounds to this problem:
<ol>
	<li>Install the game outside <q>Program Files</q> or <q>Program Files (x86)</q>. UAC prevents unauthorised edits to these folders, so by installing the game outside of them, you remove it from UAC's reach, allowing you to use mods more easily. Steam users can move their Steam installation and games using <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=7418-YUBN-8129">these instructions</a>.
	<li>Deactivate UAC. This can be done from the Control Panel, and will turn UAC off across the whole of your computer. It is up to you whether you feel that you have adequate security measures in place to do this without risk.
	<li>Give yourself <q>Full Control</q> permissions over your game install folder. This will allow you to make any edits you desire while keeping UAC active and on guard for any edits made by programs you do not run, and also means that you do not need to reinstall your game to a new location.
	<li>Run Wrye Bash as an Administrator. Right-click the <q>Wrye Bash.exe</q> and select <q>Run as administrator</q>. This can only be done if you are using the Standalone version of Wrye Bash.
</ol>
<p>For those that wish to take the third option and give themselves <q>Full Control</q> permissions, here is a guide:
<ol>
	<li>Right-click the folder you wish to change the permissions for, and select <q>Properties</q>.
	<li>In <q>Properties</q>, select the <q>Security</q> tab, and click the <q>Edit...</q> button. A UAC prompt may appear, simply allow yourself to continue.
	<li>In the <q>Group or user names</q> box, select the <q>Users</q> option.
	<li>In the lower box, check the box opposite <q>Full Control</q> in the <q>Allow</q> column. Press OK to exit. If a UAC prompt appears, allow the change.
	<li>In the <q>Properties</q> window, select OK to exit. You should now have Full Control permissions over your chosen folder.
</ol>

<h3 id="trouble-backup">Backing Up &amp; Restoring Settings</h3>
<p>The easiest method is to just run the <a href="Wrye%20Bash%20Advanced%20Readme.html#tools">Backup Settings</a> and/or <a href="Wrye%20Bash%20Advanced%20Readme.html#tools">Restore Settings</a> commands, which are available in the <a href="Wrye%20Bash%20Advanced%20Readme.html#tools-settings">Settings menu</a>. These commands do not backup/restore any mod files or saves, just the Wrye Bash settings/data. When run, the commands ask you for the location you wish to back up to or restore from.
<p>If you wish to manually back up your settings, the directories Wrye Bash stores files in are below.
<table>
	<thead><tr><th>Directory<th>Contents
	<tbody>
		<tr><td>[Game]\Mopy								<td>Main Bash files. If you're working on any localisation files in <code>Mopy\l10n</code> you may want to back them up.
		<tr><td>[Game]\Data\Bash Patches					<td>Contains CSV files used by the import/export functions. Back up any CSV files you've exported and want to keep.
		<tr><td>[Game]\Data\Docs							<td>Contains mod readmes. Doesn't need backing up.
		<tr><td>[Game]\Data\INI Tweaks					<td>Contains ini tweaks. Only needs backing up if you've added custom ini tweaks.
		<tr><td>Documents\My Games\[Game]					<td>Contains Wrye Bash settings. It is important to back this up.
		<tr><td>[Game] Mods (in the same folder as [Game])<td>Contains BAIN packages and other Wrye Bash settings. it is important to back this up.
</table>

<h3 id="trouble-report">How To Report Bugs Helpfully</h3>
<p>Bugs should be reported in an official Wrye Bash thread (links can be found in the <a href="#contact">Contact</a> section of this document). In order to best help you, the following information is required.
<ul>
	<li>Your Wrye Bash version. This includes whether it's the Python or Standalone install, the version number and the SVN number (the latter only if using the SVN).
	<li>The symptoms. Provide a step-by-step description of what you did, what you expected and what happened.
	<li>What you see. Error messages are very helpful.
	<li>Your version of Windows. If you're using Windows with UAC enabled and you have your game in the default install directory, please resolve any permissions issues using one of the methods in the <a href="#permissions">File Permissions</a> section before reporting any bugs.
	<li>Any modifications you have made to your bash.ini, if you are using one.
	<li>If you're having an issue with the Standalone version, make sure to uninstall any Python components on your computer and try again, as they can sometimes interfere.
	<li>If the issue is related to the <a href="#patch">Bashed Patch</a>, please include the following:
	<ul>
		<li>Your load order. Get this by right clicking on a column header in the Mods tab, and selecting <a href="#modsListMods">List Mods...</a>.
		<li>Your Bash Tags. Get this by right clicking on a column header in the Mods tab, and selecting <a href="#modsListBashTags">List Bash Tags...</a>.
		<li>Your <a href="#patch">Bashed Patch</a> config. Get this by right clicking on the <a href="#patch">Bashed Patch</a> and selecting <a href="Wrye%20Bash%20Advanced%20Readme.html#modsListPatchConfig">List Patch Config...</a>.
	</ul>
</ul>

<h3 id="trouble-known">Known Bugs</h3>
<p>Wrye Bash, being a complex program, has a few bugs that are known to its developers. The team is aware of the issues below and will fix them if possible.
<ul>
	<li>Mapped paths and junction links can confuse Wrye Bash, leading to file not found errors. Avoid using mapped paths and junction links for your game install.
</ul>

MemoryError</code>
			<td>This is Wrye Bash running out of memory while trying to save its settings. Usually this will occur when a user has a very large BAIN setup, and it will happen after rebuilding the Bashed Patch. Saving Wrye Bash's settings involves some memory overhead, so usually happens while saving settings.
			<td>If you start seeing this error, it means you have enough information in BAIN to push Wrye Bash to the 2GB limit of memory for 32-bit applications.  Either:
			<ul>
				<li>Avoid rebuilding the Bashed Patch after using BAIN.  Instead, restart Wrye Bash, then rebuild the Bashed Patch.
				<li>If running the Python source, try enabling the LAA flag on python.exe and pythonw.exe.  For 64-bit OS users, this may allow Wrye Bash up to almost 4GB of memory before crashing.
				<li>If running the Standalone executable, try enabling the LAA flag on Wrye Bash.exe.
				<li>If you do not need access to CBash, you can setup your Python environment using 64-bit Python.
