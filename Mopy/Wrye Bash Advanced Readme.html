<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
<p>Wrye Bash is a powerful mod management utility for TES IV: Oblivion and TES V: Skyrim. Its features include:
<ul>
	<li>A mod installation and conflict manager
	<li>A plugin load order manager
	<li>Increased mod compatibility
	<li>Lifting of the 255 plugin limit through automatic merging of compatible mods
	<li>.ini and settings files tweak management
	<li>Screenshot management
	<li>Many, many more features
</ul>
<p>Wrye Bash can appear daunting at first. To help make it more manageable, the documentation has been split into a few readmes that are targeted towards different usage requirements.
<p>A companion to the <a href="Wrye%20Bash%20General%20Readme.html">General Readme</a>, this document details those features that were omitted from the aforementioned readme. These features are often more specialised, advanced or complicated, and many area geared more towards mod authors than mod users. This readme is also more technical and goes into more depth on how Wrye Bash functions. It assumes the reader has previously read the General Readme.
<p>Note that the <a href="#people">People</a> and <a href="#pm">PM Archive</a> tabs are hidden by default. You can toggle the visibility of the tabs in Wrye Bash's main tab bar by right-clicking the tab bar and checking or unchecking the options in the context menu displayed.

<h2 id="install">Advanced Installation</h2>
<h3 id="install-alternate">Alternative Install Locations</h3>
<p>Wrye Bash can be installed in any folder, but if it is installed outside of the game's folder, then the OblivionPath bash.ini option must be adjusted.
<p>To do so:
<ol>
	<li>Open <code>bash_default.ini</code> in the <code>Mopy</code> folder and save it as <code>bash.ini</code>.
	<li>In the new bash.ini, enter the full path of your game's installation folder (the one that contains the game's executable) for the <q>sOblivionPath</q> setting.
	<li>Save the edited bash.ini.
</ol>
<p>Alternatively, you can launch Wrye Bash with the -o argument, quoting the path as the argument's parameter. Note that backslashes must be doubled as Python treats a single backslash as an escape character. For example, <code>"Wrye Bash Launcher.pyw" -o "C:\\Games\\Oblivion\\"</code> if you are running Wrye Bash for Oblivion.


<h3 id="install-components">Python Components</h3>
<p>If you are installing the Python version of Wrye Bash and wish to install the Python dependencies separately, the following must be installed.
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.3/python-2.7.3.msi">Python 2.7.3</a>
	<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/wxpython/files/wxPython/2.8.12.1/wxPython2.8-win32-unicode-2.8.12.1-py27.exe">wxPython 2.8.12.1 unicode for Python 2.7</a>
	<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/Build%20217/pywin32-217.win32-py2.7.exe/download">PyWin32</a>: This component is required for Wizards to function. If you do not wish to use Wizards, then it need not be installed.
	<li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/comtypes/files/comtypes/0.6.2/comtypes-0.6.2.win32.exe/download">Comtypes 0.6.2</a>: This is an optional component, only required for users of the PM Archives tab. If Comtypes is not installed, the PM Archives tab will not be visible.
</ul>

<h2 id="bain">Installers Tab</h2>
<h3 id="bain-ui">The User Interface In Detail</h3>
<p>The Installers tab is split into three main sections: on the left is the Package List, and the right is split between the Information Tabs at the top and the Comments / WizBAIN Editor field at the bottom. The Information Tabs and Comments / WizBAIN Editor sections display information specific to the currently selected package. Much of the contents of the Information Tabs depends on the install status and order of the package. The information tabs are detailed in the table below.
<table>
	<thead>
		<tr><th colspan="2">Information Tabs
		<tr><th>Tab<th>Description
	<tbody>
		<tr><td>General<td>Shows summary info and the files to be installed, as determined by sub-package, esp/m, voice filtering, etc.
		<tr><td>Matched<td>Shows files which are identical to current Data directory files.
		<tr><td>Missing<td>Files which are missing from the Data directory.
		<tr><td>Mismatched<td>Files which are present in the data directory, but which aren't identical to the selected package's version of those files.
		<tr><td>Conflicts<td>Shows which other packages will conflict the current package and for what files. Note that if a given file is mismatched, but the mismatch isn't due to other packages, then it won't appear. This report can be modified to show inactive conflicts and lower order conflicts by enabling the <a href="#bainShowInactiveConflicts">Show Inactive Conflicts</a> and <a href="#bainShowLowerConflicts">Show Lower Conflicts</a> options respectively.
		<tr><td>Underriden<td>Shows packages which should be overridden, but are not, due to install order errors. This can be corrected by running <a href="#bainAnneal">Anneal</a> or <a href="#bainAnnealAll">Anneal All</a>.
		<tr><td>Dirty<td>Shows files which the selected package previously installed, but which now should be removed or altered due to a reconfiguration of the package. Dirty files can be cleared by running <a href="#bainAnneal">Anneal</a> or <a href="#bainAnnealAll">Anneal All</a>.
		<tr><td>Skipped<td>Shows which files in the selected package were <a href="#bain-skipped">skipped</a> by Bain.
</table>
<p>The Comments / WizBAIN Editor panel serves two functions: for packages without a Wizard it can be used to store notes on the package; and for packages with a Wizard, or packages for which you wish to create a Wizard, it can be used as a Wizard editor with many useful features.

<h3 id="bain-editor">The WizBAIN Editor</h3>
<p>The WizBAIN Editor, which doubles as the Comments panel when not being used to edit Wizards, is a work-in-progress feature designed to aid in the creation and editing of Wizards. If a package already contains a Wizard, then it can be opened for viewing in the WizBAIN Editor using the <a href="#bainViewWizardInComments">View Wizard In Comments...</a> package context menu command.
<p>The editor supports Wizard syntax highlighting, so keywords are red, functions are purple, strings are yellow and numbers are red. Comments recieve no highlighting. The editor also supports code folding for conditional code blocks such as those beginning <code>If</code>, <code>Else</code> and <code>SelectOne</code>. The beginning of a foldable section of code is given a green arrow in the grey column to the right of the line number column, and clicking this arrow will collapse or expand that section.
<p>Most of the editor's functionality is exposed through mouse gesture context menus, of which there are nine possible variations, with each context menu displayed for a different gesture. Gestures are performed by holding down the right mouse button and moving your mouse in one direction, then releasing the right mouse button. The movement of your mouse is displayed during the gesture as a yellow trace, and on release of the right mouse button the context menu corresponding to the gesture performed is displayed. 
<p>The gestures and their corresponding context menu commands are detailed in the table below. All gestures are straight lines in a single direction, with the first entry in their menus being a numbered code corresponding to the keyboard numpad key that the gesture would land on if the mouse were centred on the "5" key (eg. top right has the code <q>MGM9</q>). The gesture menus have many empty entries, commonly labelled <q>Needs Label &amp; ID</q>, that have no functionality and as such are not detailed.
<table id="bainHeaderCommands">
	<thead>
		<tr><th colspan="3">WizBAIN Editor Gestures &amp; Context Menus
		<tr><th>Gesture Direction<th>Context Menu Command<td>Description
	<tbody>
  <tr><td rowspan="10"><i>No movement</i><td>Undo<td>Behaves as standard, undoing the last action performed.
  <tr><td>Redo<td>Behaves as standard, redoing the last undone action.
  <tr><td>Cut<td>Behaves as standard, removing the selected text from the editor panel and adding it to the clipboard.
  <tr><td>Copy<td>Behaves as standard, copying the selected text from the editor panel to the clipboard.
  <tr><td>Paste<td>Behaves as standard, pasting the text in the clipboard into the selected position in the editor.
  <tr><td>Delete<td>Removes the selected text from the editor panel, but does not copy it to the clipboard.
  <tr><td>Select All<td>Selects all the text in the editor panel.
  <tr><td>Remove Trailing Whitespace<td>Trims any whitespace from the ends of all the lines of text in the editor panel.
  <tr><td>File->Save As This Project's Wizard<td>Saves the contents of the editor panel as the current package's Wizard, overwriting any existing Wizard that may be present.
  <tr><td>Mouse Gesture Menus<td>This submenu is displayed for all gesture context menus, and allows the switching between different gesture context menus without requiring their gestures to be performed.
  <tr><td rowspan="2">Right<td>Txt2Wiz (FileDrop)<td>Opens up a floating miniframe into which a file can be drag and dropped and its contents converted to a wizard string for use in the editor panel.
  <tr><td>Txt2WWiz (TextDrop)<td>Opens up a floating miniframe into which text can be drag and dropped and it converted to a wizard string for use in the editor panel.
  <tr><td rowspan="5">Top Right<td>Show Whitespace<td>Cycles the display of whitespace symbols between three settings. The default is to display all whitespace symbols. Selecting the option once sets the editor to display whitespace symbols outside indentation only, and selecting the option a second time turns off all display of whitespace symbols. Selecting the option a third time turns back on display of all whitespace symbols.
  <tr><td>Toggle Indent Guides<td>Toggles the display of vertical dashed lines that are displayed in intervals equal to the default tab space size (often 4 spaces).
  <tr><td>Toggle Wordwrap<td>Toggles the wrapping of text to fit within the panel without any horizontal scrolling, similar to many other text editors.
  <tr><td>Highlight Selected Line<td>Toggles the highlighting of the currently selected line in the editor using a grey background.
  <tr><td>Toggle EOL View<td>Toggles the display of symbols for end-of-line characters, similar to many other text editors.
</table>


<h3 id="bain-skipped">Skipped Files</h3>
<p>BAIN skips the installation of some files and directories. The types of files skipped are:
<ul>
	<li>Silent skips. These are thumbs.db files, and the omod conversion directory and its subfiles.
	<li>Developer files. Any file or directory that begins with '--' and is at the top level of a package or a subpackage will be silently skipped. This is so that mod authors can include files related to a mod that are not required for it to work (eg. screenshots) in packages.
	<li>Non-standard directories. Standard directories include all the game's default directories (including those only found in BSAs by default) and 'ini', ini tweaks', 'pluggy', 'scripts', 'streamline' and '_tejon'. Installation of these directories may be forced by using the <a href="#bainHasExtraDirectories">Has Extra Directories</a> option. Files skipped because of this will be listed in the <q>Skipped</q> panel on the right.
	<li>Archives &amp; executables. Executable files, apart from Script Extender plugins if the <a href="#bainSkipOBSEPlugins">Skip OBSE Plugins</a> option is disabled, and archives in packages will be skipped. Files skipped because of this will be listed in the <q>Skipped</q> panel on the right.
	<li>Specified skips. There are a few options in BAIN to skip the installation of certain file types. If any such options are enabled, the file type(s) in question will be skipped.
</ul>


<h3 id="bain-se">Script Extender Plugin Installation</h3>
<p>Script Extender (OBSE, SKSE) plugins (.dll, .dlx extensions) may be installed through BAIN if the following conditions are met:
<ul>
	<li>The package or subpackage containing the OBSE plugin has it in <code>OBSE\Plugins</code> (for Oblivion), <code>SKSE\Plugins</code> (for Skyrim) or a subfolder of the same.
	<li>The <a href="#bainSkipOBSEPlugins">Skip OBSE Plugins</a> option found in the Installers tab column header context menu is disabled.
</ul>
<p>When attempting to install a specific Script Extender plugin for the first time, Wrye Bash will display a warning dialogue and ask you to confirm or deny the plugin's installation. Thereafter you can uninstall and install the plugin as you like without seeing the warning. These additional requirements are due to the significant (though currently theoretical) dangers of installing executable files.
<p>The list of allowed and disallowed Script Extender plugins can be imported and exported using the <a href="#settingsImportList">Import list of allowed/disallowed OBSE plugin dlls</a> and <a href="#settingsExportList">Export list of allowed/disallowed OBSE plugin dlls</a> options in Wrye Bash's <a href="#settings">Settings</a> menu.


<h3 id="bain-omod">OMOD Conversion Data</h3>
<p>If a mod author is building a mod that supports BAIN, manual and OMOD installs, they can use the <a href="#bainOmodInfo">Omod Info...</a> option in the package context menu to create or update the OMOD config file.
<p>If a mod author wishes to include a screenshot for use by the OMOD, they simply need to copy the screenshot saved as a JPEG to the OMOD Conversion Data folder and rename it to <q>screenshot</q> with no file extension.
<p>An OMOD installation script may also be created by creating a text file named <q>script.txt</q> and writing the script in any text editor. Testing is still best done in OBMM though.
<p>The OMOD config file is the only true requirement for an OMOD to be created from OMOD Conversion Data. The screenshot and installation script can be used to enhance an OMOD. Note that the <q>info.txt</q> file that OMODs create when exporting Conversion Data in OBMM is unnecessary, and is provided for purely informational purposes.


<h3 id="bain-bcf">BAIN Conversion Files</h3>
<p><abbr title="BAIN Conversion Files">BCFs</abbr> are effectively automated archive converters, converting an existing archive or several archives into a new layout. They can be used to make BAIN-incompatible archives compatible, or make compatible archives easier to install. As they don't contain any files that are found in the existing archive(s), the only copyright/permissions that apply are those that the BCF creator stipulates, which generally makes distribution easier. BCFs are also usually much smaller, only containing new files that it adds (commonly <q>package.txt</q> and ini file tweaks) and a <q>BCF.dat</q> that tells Wrye Bash how to reorganise the archive(s).
<p>To create a BCF:
<ol>
	<li>Add all of the source archives to BAIN.
	<li>Create a new project with the contents of the source archives, and rearrange the files as you see fit.
	<li>Right-click the project and select <a href="#modsPackToArchive">Pack To Archive...</a>.
	<li>Name the new archive, and choose whether to use solid compression or not. Solid compression results in smaller file sizes, but also reduces performance.
	<li>Set any options on the new archive package that you wish to be set whenever the BCF is applied (such as default sub-packages or <q>Skip...</q> options).
	<li>Select all the source archives in the package list, then right-click them and choose <a href="#modsConversionsCreate">Conversions->Create</a>. Select the archive that you just created, and name the BCF.
	<li>Look over the result log to make sure it looks OK. If it looks wrong, try again, you may have gotten the sources/target wrong. If it looks right, you can find the new BCF in <code>[Game] Mods\Bash Installers\Bain Converters</code>. It is recommended that you copy/paste the result log into your readme for your BCF.
</ol>
<p>Some points of interest regarding BCFs:
<ul>
	<li>BCFs must end in either <code>-BCF.7z</code> or <code>-BCF-*.7z</code> (where the * is a wildcard matching any character string).
	<li>The converted archive may use 7-zip (.7z) or Zip (.zip) compression.
	<li>BCFs support an arbitrary number and level of archives embedded within an archive.
	<li>BCFs store the configuration settings of the original converted archive used when creating the BCF, allowing authors to pre-select options (see instructions above).
	<li>BCFs found to be duplicates will be moved to <code>[Game] Mods\Bash Installers\Bain Converters\--Duplicates</code>.
	<li>BCFs use data CRCs to verify the integrity of source archives. These use the contents of an archive, but not the name or type of the archive, so a source archive may be renamed or recompressed without affecting its ability to be used by a BCF. Wrye Bash displays the data CRCs of packages on the General Info tab for this reason.
</ul>


<h3 id="bain-commands">Context Menu Commands</h3>
<p>The tables below detail the full list of context menu commands available in the Mods tab.

		<tr><td colspan="2" id="bainAutoRefreshProjects">Auto-Refresh Projects<td>Toggles the auto-refreshing of projects on/off. Preferred setting: enabled.
		<tr><td colspan="2">Auto-Refresh BethSoft Content<td>Toggles whether or not refreshing the Data directory will also scan Bethsoft BSAs, ESPs, and ESMs. Enabling this option will cause a significant increase in refresh time if the timestamps on the Bethsoft BSAs are changed. Preferred setting: disabled.
		<tr><td colspan="2">Auto-Apply Embedded BCFs<td class="missing">This item has not yet been documented.
		<tr><td colspan="2">BSA Redirection<td>Uses Quarn's <a href="http://devnull.sweetdanger.net/archiveinvalidation/">BSA redirection technique</a> to avoid bugs with the engines texture getting system. This is compatible with both OBMM and Quarn's original BSA redirection approaches.
		<tr><td colspan="2">Clean Data Directory<td>If this is checked, then any empty subfolders of the Data directory will be deleted. This reduces some clutter (especially after uninstalling packages). Removing unused data directories also improves game performance.
		<tr><td colspan="2" id="bainShowInactiveConflicts">Show Inactive Conflicts<td>If checked, then the conflicts report will show conflicts with inactive as well as active mods. Usually only active conflicts are of interest, however sometimes it's useful to review all conflicting packages.
		<tr><td colspan="2" id="bainShowLowerConflicts">Show Lower Conflicts<td>If checked, then the conflicts report with show conflicts with lower order packages. If you're only interested in higher order conflicts, the uncheck this to remove some clutter from the report.
		<tr><td colspan="2">Wizard Icon Overlay<td>If checked, installers with a Wizard will have a magic wand image displayed over their icons.
		<tr><td colspan="2" id="bainSkipOBSEPlugins">Skip OBSE Plugins<td><i>Oblivion only.</i> If this is checked, files to go in the Data\OBSE\Plugins folder will not be installed.

		<tr><td colspan="2">Delete<td>Deletes the selected package(s). Deleted packages are <b>not</b> sent to the Recycling Bin, they are permanently deleted.
		<tr><td rowspan="5">Open at<td>Google...<td>Attempts to perform a Google search for the selected package's name.
		<tr><td>TES Nexus...<td>Attempts to open the selected package's page on TES Nexus.  This command assumes that the trailing digits in a package's name is the package ID at the site.
		<tr><td>Skyrim Nexus...<td>Attempts to open the selected package's page on Skyrim Nexus. This command assumes that the trailing digits in a package's name is the package ID at the site.
		<tr><td>TES Alliance...<td>Attempts to open the selected package's page on TES Alliance. This command assumes that the trailing digits in a package's name is the package ID at the site.

		<tr><td colspan="2">Rename...<td>Renames the selected package or marker.
		<tr><td colspan="2">Refresh<td>Refreshes all info for the selected package(s). Since BAIN refreshes package information whenever Wrye Bash regains focus after losing it (ie. you select another program's window, then switch back to Wrye Bash), this is only useful if a package has been changed and it has <a href="#bainDontRefresh">Don't Refresh</a> selected, or the <a href="#bainAutoRefreshProjects">Auto-Refresh Projects</a> option is disabled. Note that scanning a project for changes takes much longer than scanning an archive for changes.
		<tr><td colspan="2">Move To...<td>Moves the selected package(s) to the specified position.
		<tr><td colspan="2" id="bainHasExtraDirectories">Has Extra Directories<td>BAIN only recognises a limited set of subdirectories of the Data folder, and skips any unrecognised subdirectories. Checking this option will cause BAIN to install unrecognised subdirectories.
		<tr><td colspan="2">Override Skips<td>If this is checked, Bain will not skip over files that would normally be skipped due to the Skip XX options.
		<tr><td colspan="2">Skip Voices<td>If this is checked, Bain will skip over any voice files in the package. This is useful if the voice files are empty and/or the user prefers not to use them. If this option is used, then the user should also use Elys' <a href="http://oblivion.nexusmods.com/mods/16622">Universal Silent Voice</a> extension to prevent dialog subtitles from fading too rapidly.
		<tr><td colspan="2" id="bainDontRefresh">Don't Refresh<td>When refreshing Projects, this package won't get refreshed. The package will only get refreshed on a Full Refresh, or by manually selecting Refresh.
		<tr><td colspan="2">Wizard<td>Runs the Wizard for the package, if it has one.
		<tr><td colspan="2">Auto Wizard<td>Runs the Wizard for the package, if it has one, selecting the default options.

		<tr><td colspan="2">Install Last<td>Moves the package to the end of the order list and installs it.
		<tr><td colspan="2">Install Missing<td>The same as Install, except that it only installs missing files – i.e. it will not override any currently existing files.
		<tr><td colspan="2">Uninstall<td>Uninstalls the package. If Auto-Anneal is active (the default) then files from earlier packages that were previously overriden will be installed as required.
		<tr><td rowspan="2">Conversions<td>Create...<td>Archives only. Creates a new Bain Conversion File.
		<tr><td>Apply->[BCF]<td>[BCF] is the name of a Bain Conversion File listed in the Apply submenu. Selecting a BCF applies it to the selected package.

		<tr><td colspan="2" id="modsPackToArchive">Pack to Archive...<td>Projects only. Packs the project to an archive. It defaults to .7z, but also supports .zip.
		<tr><td colspan="2">Package For Release...<td>Projects only. Just like "Pack to Archive" except it doesn't archive the following: thumbs.db, desktop.ini, and any folder that begins with "--".
		<tr><td colspan="2">Sync From Data<td>Projects only. Synchronize the project with files from the Data directory. This is essentially the reverse of "Install" for projects since it copies from the Data directory to the project rather than the other way around.
		<tr><td colspan="2">Copy Conflicts to Project<td>Copies all files that conflict with the selected package into a new project. Useful for comparing conflicting resources.
		<tr><td colspan="2" id="bainOmodInfo">Omod Info...<td>Projects only. Allows you to read/write omod configuration info.

<h2 id="mods">Mods Tab</h2>
<h3 id="mods-exclusion">Exclusion Groups</h3>
<p>Exclusion groups can be used to help flag plugins that are incompatible. Incompatible plugins can be placed into exclusion groups, and when more than one plugin in a group is present, the plugins will be highlighted in orange.
<p>An exlusion group may be defined or added to by renaming a plugin, putting the exclusion group name first, then a comma, then the plugin's original name. Eg. <code>Group, My plugin.esp</code>. If plugins share the same exclusion group name, they will be members of the same exclusion group.
<p><b>Note:</b> The usage of exclusion groups is not recommended. Renaming plugins will cause them to become unrecognised by features such as BAIN or utilities such as BOSS that expect plugins to have the names they are distributed with. Renaming plugins will also break any plugins that are dependent on them.

<img src="bash/images/Mods-Plugin-Details-Panel.png" alt="plugin details panel"/>
<figcaption>The plugin details panel on the right hand side of the Mods tab.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The plugin details panel contains the following:
<table>
	<thead><tr><th>Item<th>Description
	<tbody>
		<tr><td>File Name<td>The filename of the selected plugin. Note that changing this does not change the filename in the Masters Lists of any dependent plugins.
		<tr><td>Modification Time<td>For Oblivion, this affects the load order of the selected plugin. For Skyrim, it has no effect, except that if it is changed for a plugin obtained from Steam Workshop, it will cause the plugin to be redownloaded as Steam Workshop uses modification time to detect file versions.
		<tr><td>Author<td>Who made the selected plugin.
		<tr><td>Description<td>Commonly used for a short description of what the selected plugin does, plus the version number and any Bash Tags the author sets.
		<tr><td>Masters List<td>The plugins (.esm or .esp) that the selected plugin depends on, and their indices (positions in load order). Plugins' entries in the Masters List may be renamed to reflect name changes of the plugins themselves. Renaming can be done by left-clicking the plugin entry and editing in the column display, or right-clicking the plugin and selecting <q>Change To...</q> then selecting the replacement plugin. <b>Do not</b> use this to change a plugin's masters to unrelated plugins, as this will cause file corruption.
		<tr><td>Bash Tags<td>This field lists any Bash Tags that are assigned to the selected plugin. Right-clicking will display a list of Bash Tags and allow you to add or remove tags by checking or unchecking them.
</table>

<h3 id="mods-csv">CSV Files</h3>
<p>Wrye Bash uses CSV files for many of its plugin data related features. CSV files are a very widely supported type of spreadsheet file, and once exported may be edited in programs like Microsoft Excel, LibreOffice Calc or even in text editors such as Notepad or Notepad++.
<p>CSV files are used by the Import/Export... commands as this allows much easier editing of record data in large batches or in systematic manners than in the Construction Set. The data may be exported, edited in the CSV, then imported again. The following notes apply to CSV files.
<ul>
	<li>Wrye Bash will ignore any lines in a CSV file for which the second column does not begin with <code>0x</code>, so such lines can be used for comments.
	<li>For Sigil Stones and Spell Stats CSV exports, additional effects can be added to a stone/spell by appending effects to the end of a line, leaving one blank column between each effect. If any of the Script Effect columns are set to <q>None</q> then all the script effects for that effect will be ignored.
	<li>For the values of object stats such as price or weight or damage, etc., formulae may be used to work out the numerical values, but the file should contain the resulting numbers, not the formulae used.
	<li>The faction lists for actors do not need to be complete - only the actor/faction pairs added or changed need to be listed. A rank of -1 in a faction will remove an actor from that faction.
	<li>Relation lists do not need to be complete for each faction - only the added/changed main/other pairs need to be listed.
</ul>
<p>CSV files can also be used when building the Bashed Patch, for a number of options. The Bashed Patch builder will automatically detect the presence of any CSV files in the <code>Data\Bash Patches</code> folder and have the correct filename ending. These filename endings are:
<table>
	<thead><tr><th>Import Type<th>Required Filename Ending

	<tbody>
		<tr><td rowspan="5">Load<td id="modsLoadAll">All<td>Activates all the plugins in the mod list.
		<tr><td>None<td>Deactivates all the plugins in the mod list.
		<tr><td>Save List...<td>Saves the current load order to a new load list.
		<tr><td>Edit Lists...<td>Allows the deletion and renaming of load lists.
		<tr><td>[Load List]<td>[Load List] is the name of a load list, which are listed below the separator in the Load submenu. Clicking a load list will apply it, deactivating any plugins that are not listed as active in it.
		<tr><td colspan="2">Sort By<td>This submenu allows you to choose by which column the plugin list is sorted. This is equivalent to clicking on a column header. You can also choose to sort by <q>Type</q>, which will place .esms before .esps regardless of the sorting criteria, or by <q>Selection</q>, which places selected plugins before unselected plugins regardless of criteria.
		<tr><td colspan="2">Oblivion.esm<td><i>Oblivion only.</i> This submenu relates to <a href="#tools-swapping">Oblivion.esm Swapping</a>.
		<tr><td colspan="2">Columns<td>This submenu allows you to choose which columns are visible in the mod list.
		<tr><td rowspan="4">File<td>New Bashed Patch...<td>Creates a new Bashed Patch plugin. Useful if you accidently delete your current one or wish to have more than one.
		<tr><td>New Mod...<td>Creates an empty plugin.
		<tr><td>Open...<td>Opens the Data folder in Windows Explorer.
		<tr><td>Unhide...<td>Opens a dialogue window allowing you to select which hidden plugins to unhide. 
		<tr><td colspan="2" id="modsListMods">List Mods<td>This outputs a BBCode-formatted load order, including version information, activation status and major load order errors. It can be useful for debugging a broken load order. If the 'c' keyboard key is pressed when this command is selected, the CRCs of plugins will also be displayed in the output.
		<tr><td colspan="2">List Bash Tags<td>This outputs a BBCode-formatted list of all the Bash Tags applied to the plugins in your load order, and where/how the Bash Tags were specified. It can be useful for debugging a broken load order.
		<tr><td colspan="2" id="modsAutoGhost">Auto-Ghost<td>The game engine has a bug where it reads all the plugins in the Data folder, and this can affect performance when the number of plugins is around 300+. Auto-Ghosting adds a <q>.ghost</q> extension to all inactive plugins automatically to prevent the game engine reading them, and so helping to avoid the performance drop. When a ghosted plugin is activated, the <q>.ghost</q> extension is removed, allowing it to function as normal. Note that other utilities will not recognise ghosted plugins, so there are options available for individual plugins to control which get ghosted.
		<tr><td colspan="2">Lock Load Order<td>This prevents other utilities from altering plugin modification times. More accurately, it detects changes to modification times when Wrye Bash is focussed (ie. on top of all other program windows) and reverses those changes.
		<tr><td colspan="2">Debug Mode<td>Activates debug output. Only a few commands will display any debug output, but it may be useful for troubleshooting.
		<tr><td colspan="2">TES4Edit Expert<td>If checked, this option runs TES4Edit with the <code>-IKnowWhatImDoing</code> argument, activating more advanced functionality, whenever TES4Edit is run from its launcher in the status bar.
		<tr><td colspan="2" id="modsRemoveDummyMasters">Remove Dummy Masters...<td>Removes all dummy master files created using <a href="#modsCreateDummyMasters">Create Dummy Masters...</a> on a plugin.
		<tr><td colspan="2">Check mods against BOSS's dirty mod list<td>BOSS's masterlist contains information on dirty plugins that can be used by Wrye Bash to highlight these plugins in the mod list. Checking this setting tells Wrye Bash to use this information if BOSS is installed.

Snapshot filenames are appended with <code>-n</code> where n is a number between 01 and 99. Eg. the first snapshot of <code>Plugin.esp</code> is <code>Plugin-01.esp</code>. The number is incremented each time the plugin has a snapshot taken. Additionally, if there is a version line in the plugin's description field, then the snapshot number will be appended to the version number in the same manner.
		<tr><td>Delete<td><b>Permanently</b> deletes the selected plugin, and any backups of it, but not snapshots.

		<tr><td rowspan="15">Import<td>Editor Ids...<td><b>For advanced mod authors only.</b> Imports the Editor IDs for records in the selected plugin from a CSV file. As well as updating the Editor IDs of records themselves, this also updates any Editor IDs referenced in normal (non quest stage or dialogue) scripts to reflect the changes. <b>Note:</b> You may have to recompile any altered scripts in the Construction Set.
		<p>If you wish to update script references <i>after</i> the Editor IDs were changed, edit the CSV file and add another column after the eid column and give the old Editor IDs in the new column. E.g. <code>MISC Oblivion.esm 0x0123456 newEid oldEid</code>
		<tr><td>Groups...<td>Imports groups for the selected plugin from a CSV file as created by the Export Groups command.

		<tr><td id="modsImportNames">Names...<td>Imports names for objects from a CSV file into the selected plugin. Only records that already exist in the plugin will have their names changed, no records will be added.
		<tr><td id="modsImportNPCLevels">NPC Levels...<td><b>For advanced mod authors only.</b> Imports NPC level info from a CSV file into the selected plugin. This does not affect Creature levels or leveled lists, nor does it affect the levels of NPCs in existing saves, for which <a href="savesUpdateNPCLevels">Update NPC Levels</a> must be used. As well as the format exported by <a href="modsExportNPCLevels">Export NPC Levels</a>, an older format is supported:
			<ul>
				<li>The first column is the Form ID. <b>This must not have been edited.</b>
				<li>The second column is the Editor ID, which is ignored on import.
				<li>The next three columns are the levelling info.
				<li>The last four columns are the original NPC levels from the game's master file. If the NPCs are mod-added, these will be blank. These columns are ignored on import.

		<tr><td id="modsImportSigilStones">Sigil Stones...<td>Imports the stats of sigil stones from a CSV file into the selected plugin.
		<tr><td id="modsImportSpellStats">Spells...<td>Imports spell stats from a CSV file into the selected plugin. Only records that exist in the plugin will have their spell stats change, no records will be added. The spell stats supported are those exported by <a href="#modsExportSpellStats">Export Spell Stats...</a>, and importing uses the same Basic and Detailed mode distinctions.
		<tr><td id="modsImportStats">Stats...<td>Imports stats from a CSV file into the selected plugin. Only records that exist in the plugin will have their stats change, no records will be added. The object stats supported are those exported by <a href="#modsExportStats">Export Stats...</a>.
		<tr><td id="modsImportFace">Face...<td>This command relates to <a href="#saves-face">Face Importing</a>.
		<tr><td id="modsImportFormIDs">FormIDs...<td><b>For advanced mod authors only.</b> It is useful if you want to replace the records in one master with equivalent records in another master. This command replaces the Form IDs in a plugin according to a CSV file that acts as a Form ID mapper. An example of such a file is <code>Data\Bash Patches\TI to Cobl_Formids.csv</code>. The instructions below detail how to create a Form ID mapper.
			<ol>
				<li>Use <a href="modsExportEditorIDs">Export Editor Ids</a> on both the plugin containing the Form IDs to be replaced and the plugin containing the replacement Form IDs. 
				<li>Combine the two CSV files produced into a CSV file with the following columns:
				<ul>
					<li>Record type. This is ignored by Wrye Bash, but can be useful for reference.
					<li>Old Mod. This supplies the first two digits in the old Form ID.
					<li>Old Object. This supplies the rest of the old Form ID.
					<li>Old Eid. The Editor ID for the old object.
					<li>New Eid. The Editor ID for the new object.
					<li>New Mod This supplies the first two digits in the new Form ID.
					<li>New Object. This supplies the rest of the new Form ID.
				</ul>
				<p>Note that if either of the new or old sides of a row are empty, the row will be skipped. Also, the new object does not have to be of the same type as the old object, but they should be compatible.
				<li>Save the new CSV file so that its filename ends with <q>Formids.csv</q>.
			</ol>
			<p>If you've completely swapped from one base plugin to another, you may wish to remove the old dependency. This can be done using TES4Edit's <q>Clean Masters</q> command or TES4Gecko's <q>Edit Master List</q> command. The former only removes totally unused masters while the latter can remove used masters with the appropriate cleanup, and is not an automated procedure.
			<p><b>Note:</b> You can also use TES4Edit to change the Form IDs using its <q>Batch Change Referencing Records</q> command together with the CSV file created. TES4Edit will also change the definition of a Form ID, rather than just any references to it, unlike Wrye Bash.

		<tr><td id="modsRemoveWorldOrphans">Remove World Orphans<td>Some plugins have a mild form of corruption where exterior cells of new worldspaces in an esp master of the plugin are included in the plugin even if they are not edited, but the parent worldspace is not included, creating "orphaned" cells. This command removes these "orphans".
		<tr><td id="modsNvidiaFogFix">Nvidia Fog Fix<td>Systems with Nvidia graphics cards can suffer a black screen bug when interior cell fog distances are set to 0.

		<tr><td id="modsUndeleteRefs">Undelete Refs<td><b>This is an experimental feature for advanced mod authors. If you're trying to undelete references, you should probably use TES4Edit instead.</b> Deleted references can cause crashes. This command undeletes references and disables them instead. However, the undeleted reference does not contain the missing data caused by deletion. TES4Edit can add this data back in.

		<tr><td colspan="2" id="modsEsmifySelf">Esmify/Espify Self<td>The distinction between esp and esm plugins is not dependent on their file extensions, but by a bit in the file. This command toggles that bit so that .esp files behave as .esm files and vice versa. It is useful for creating and editing plugins with .esp files as masters, which cannot be done in the Construction Set otherwise. Esm files cannot be edited in the Construction Set as esp files, so this command is disabled for them. <b>Warning:</b> Make sure to toggle any plugins back before playing the game, otherwise savegames will get confused, possibly causing bugs and corruption.

<h2 id="patch">Advanced Bashed Patch</h2>
<p>You can have multiple Bashed Patches, though one is generally enough per <a href="#saves-profiles">save profile</a> or character. The only requirement for Wrye Bash recognising a plugin as a Bashed Patch is that its <q>Author</q> field is set to <q>BASHED PATCH</q>, so you can name a Bashed Patch whatever you want.
<h3 id="patch-view">Viewing &amp; Editing The Bashed Patch</h3>
<p>As the Bashed Patch commonly has .esp files as masters, viewing and editing it can be more complicated than for the average plugin. If you wish to view its contents, it is easiest to use <a href="http://oblivion.nexusmods.com/mods/11536">TES4Edit</a>, which can also be used to edit most types of data in plugins. To edit it using the Construction Set or Creation Kit (required when editing scripts), you'll need to first use the <a href="#modsEsmifyMasters">Esmify Masters</a> command on it. Be sure to use <q>Espify Masters</q> before attempting to play the game.

<h3 id="patch-tags">Bash Tags</h3>
<p>Wrye Bash uses a tagging system to determine what mods can and should have which records available for importing into the Bashed Patch. These Bash Tags are specified by mod authors in the header descriptions of their plugins, or are applied using data from three sources:
<ul>
	<li>BOSS's <code>masterlist.txt</code> and <code>userlist.txt</code> files. If BOSS is installed, then Wrye Bash will apply its Bash Tag suggestions. You do not need to use BOSS to benefit from this, it just needs to be installed. REPLACE lines in the userlist will replace Bash Tags suggested in the masterlist, but will not affect Bash Tags specified in plugin description fields.
	<li>The <code>Bash Patches\Leveled Lists.csv</code> file. This file contains a small list that is useful if BOSS is not installed.
	<li>The <code>Bash Patches\taglist.txt</code> file. This is a stripped-down version of the BOSS masterlist as it was when the version of Wrye Bash installed was released.
</ul>
<p>Bash Tags may also be set manually, by right-clicking a plugin's Bash Tags field in the Mods Tab sidebar and checking or unchecking tags in the list displayed. If you wish to revert to automatic tagging, choose <q>Automatic</q> in the right-click list. If you are a mod author, you may wish to use <q>Copy to Description</q> for your mod's plugins before releasing it to ensure that users have the tags applied automatically.
<p><b>Note:</b> A Bash Tag should only be applied when it is <b>important</b> that the plugin's change to whatever the Tag relates to is preserved. If a change your plugin makes is not important to the functioning of your mod, do not add a Bash Tag for it. Doing otherwise negates the purpose of the Bash Tag system.

<h3 id="#patch-filter">Merge Filtering</h3>
<p>Merge filtering is an advanced option that allows records in a merged mod to be selectively filtered according to the current load order. For example, a patch mod could be created to rebalance weapons from several different weapon-adding mods. This feature would allow the patch to be used even if you didn't use all the mods, and the Bashed Patch would just apply the bits for the mods you do use. This saves the need for a separate patch plugin for each mod.
<p>Merge filtering has requisite conditions that must be fulfilled for a plugin to take advantage of it, and some limitations. These conditions and limitations are:
<ul>
	<li>The plugin must be mergeable and tagged with <code>Filter</code>.
	<li>The plugin must not be active at the time the patch is built. Note that if the user doesn't have all the plugin's masters installed, it will have to remain deactivated at all times.
	<li>Filtering is done according to the currently active plugins: it is therefore very important that all the desired plugins are active when the Bashed Patch is built.
	<li>Filtering is mostly limited to the top level, ie. if the plugin a record is from is missing, the record will be skipped. However, if a record references another record, and the latter's plugin is missing, the former will not be skipped, and the Bashed Patch will end up dependent on the latter's plugin being installed.
	<li>There are a few exceptions to the above limitation: entries in leveled lists will be filtered, as will spells, factions and items referenced in Creature and NPC records.
</ul>


<h3 id="#patch-iim">Item Interchange Mode</h3>
<p>Item Interchange Mode is a 'hack' (a horribly inelegant and inconsistent implementation of a feature that nonetheless works) to support Vacuity's Item Interchange mod.
<p>Activation of the mode for a plugin relies on the following conditions:
<ul>
	<li>The plugin is tagged with <code>IIM</code>.
	<li>The plugin is being merged into the Bashed Patch.
	<li>The plugin is tagged with <code>Filter</code>.
</ul>
<p>Item Interchange Mode has the following effects:
<ul>
	<li>Prevents the records in the plugin from being merged into the Bashed Patch, apart from leveled list records, which are merged in.
	<li>Prevents all the patch components except from the Leveled Lists and Import Inventory from even looking at the plugin.
	<li>Causes Import Inventory to ignore all changes in the plugin except inventory changes.
</ul>

		<tr><td>As Intended: Imps<td>Adds the Bethesda Imp Resistances spells to imps (found by the UOP team, based off of a mod made by Tejon). May choose to apply to all imps, only full size imps, or only implings.
		<tr><td>Irresponsible Creatures<td>Sets responsibility to 0 for all/specified creatures - so they can't report you for crimes.
		<tr><td>Mayu's Animation Overhaul Skeleton Tweaker<td>Sets NPC skeletons paths to match that required for MAO to work. <b>Requires</b> Mayu's Animation Overhaul or it will almost certainly cause CTDs.
		<tr><td>No Bloody Creatures<td>Nulls the blood records of all creatures; acts like 'Mart's Monster Mod - No Blood.esp' except it is universal and doesn't work with MMM (MMM uses a different system - it won't cause any harm if used with MMM, it will just have pretty much no effect).
		<tr><td>Quiet Feet<td>Removes all/some 'foot' sounds from creatures; on some computers can have a significant performance boost.
		<tr><td>Real Walk for female NPCs<td>Changes all female NPCs to use Mur Zuk's Real Walk. <b>Requires</b> Mur Zuk's Real Walk animation file.
		<tr><td>Redguard FGTS Nuller<td>Sets Redguard NPC FGTS subrecords to null; for use with Better Redguards.
		<tr><td>Sexy Walk for female NPCs<td>Changes all female NPCs to use Mur Zuk's Sexy Walk. <b>Requires</b> Mur Zuk's Sexy Walk animation file.
		<tr><td>VadersApp's Oblivion Real Bodies Skeleton Tweaker<td>Changes all (modded and vanilla) NPCs to use diverse skeletons for different look. Not compatible with MAO. <b>Requires</b> VadersApp's Oblivion Real Bodies.
		<tr><td>Vanilla Beast Skeleton Tweaker<td>Sets any NPCs using the vanilla non-beast skeleton path (skeleton.nif) to use the beast skeleton patch (skeletonbeast.nif). This avoids bugs when a mod changes the race of an NPC to a beast race without setting the skeleton path to the beast path, in which case the tail will appear to extend forever and weird stuff like that.

		<tr><td>Armor Shows Amulets<td>Modifies playable armor to show amulets.
		<tr><td>Armor Shows Rings<td>Modifies playable armor to show rings.
		<tr><td>Bow Reach Fix<td>Some of the bows in Oblivion (and a few in user mods) have a reach of zero. Due to a bug in the Oblivion engine, if these bows are equipped by an NPC, the game will crash. This patch changes bows with zero reach to have reach of 1.
		<tr><td>Clothing Shows Amulets<td>Modifies playable clothing to show amulets.
		<tr><td>Clothing Shows Rings<td>Modifies playable clothing to show rings.
		<tr><td>DarNified Books<td>Tweaks book colours and fonts for use with DarNified UI.
		<tr><td>Default Icons<td>Sets a default icon for any records that don't have any icon assigned.
		<tr><td>Disable Wind<td>Sets wind speed for all weathers to 0; this means that bushes and trees don't move in the wind since there isn't any. May help on machines with low end graphic cards.
		<tr><td>Faction Crime Gold Multplier Fix<td>Fix factions with unset crimeGoldMultiplier to have a crimeGoldMultiplier of 1.0.
		<tr><td>Harvest Chance<td>Sets the harvest chance of all flora to the desired chance.
		<tr><td>Magic: Script Effect Silencer<td>Script Effects will be silenced and have no graphics.
		<tr><td>No Light Fade Value Fix<td>Sets the fade values on all lights to a default of 1.0 if not already set.
		<tr><td>No Light Flicker<td>Turns off flickering effects for lights. May help on machines with low end graphic cards.
		<tr><td>Number of uses for pre-enchanted weapons and Staffs/Staves<td>The charge amount and cast cost will be edited so that all enchanted weapons and staffs have the amount of uses specified. Cost will be rounded up to 1 (unless set to unlimited) so number of uses may not exactly match for all weapons.
		<tr><td>Nvidia Fog Fix<td>Ensures that cells have at least one non-zero fog value. For avoiding the Nvidia fog-related black screen. This feature is based on <a href="http://planetelderscrolls.gamespy.com/View.php?view=oblivionmods.detail&amp;id=2859">Quarn's Nvidia Black Screen Fix</a>.
		<tr><td>Reweigh: Arrows<td>Reweighs arrows to a maximum weight.
		<tr><td>Reweigh: Ingredients<td>Reweighs ingredients to a maximum weight.
		<tr><td>Reweigh: Potions (Maximum)<td>Reweighs potions to a maximum weight. This does not affect potions with script effects or with current weight >= 1.0. Thus it should not affect alcoholic beverages or scripted "potions" like HTS water skins. Note that this is similar to, but not the same as, the Reweigh Potions command for savegames, which reweighs user created potions rather than mod created potions.
		<tr><td>Reweigh: Potions (Minimum)<td>Reweighs potions to a minimum weight.
		<tr><td>Reweigh: Staffs/Staves<td>Reweighs staves to a maximum weight.
		<tr><td>Right Hand Rings<td>Makes rings behave more consistently by making all rings prefer to be on the right hand. With this tweak activated, rings will only equip to the left hand if the right hand has a ring, but the left hand does not. You can use this to make one ring permanently equipped - just equip it to the left hand and it will stay on until you specifically unequip it.
		<tr><td>Set Sound Attenuation Levels<td>The sound attenuation levels will be set to tweak%*current level, thereby increasing (or decreasing) the sound volume (lower attenuation = higher volume).
		<tr><td>Set Sound Attenuation Levels: Nirnroots Only<td>The sound attenuation levels will be set to tweak%*current level, thereby increasing (or decreasing) the sound volume (lower attenuation = higher volume). This one only affects Nirnroots.
		<tr><td>Skyrim-style Weapons<td>Sets all one handed weapons as blades, two handed weapons as blunt.
		<tr><td>Uniform Groundcover<td>Eliminates the random variation in groundcover (grass, vines, shrubs, etc). Tall groundcover will still be taller than short groundcover, but there will be less variation in size. May help on lower end machines.

<h3 id="patch-lists">Leveled Lists</h3>
<p>The leveled list patcher is slightly odd in comparison to the others: it's effectively an <q>Import...</q> patcher, but its options are decided automatically by default.
<p>First, a bit of background. When different plugins alter the same leveled list, only the last loaded plugin's changes get applied. This tends not to be what is wanted. The leveled list patcher circumvents the issue by instead merging all the changes made to leveled lists and having this merged set of changes applied.
<p>The leveled list merging is dictated by related Bash Tags, and functions as follows.
<ul>
	<li>The load order of plugins is still important to the result of the leveled list patcher. It decides what plugins' effects override others.
	<li>Untagged plugins can only add new entries to leveled lists. If such a plugin adds an entry that already exists, it will be ignored. Furthermore, even if another plugin has already marked that entry as removed, it will not be re-added.
	<li><code>Delev</code> tagged plugins can remove entries from leveled lists. Any items present in such a plugin's masters but not in the plugin itself will be removed.
	<li><code>Relev</code> tagged plugins can relevel an existing entry (ie. change its levels and/or counts in the list), and can also override previous deletions of entries from leveled lists. However, it does not prevent a later-loading <code>Delev</code> tagged plugin from then removing an entry again.
	<li><code>Delev</code> and <code>Relev</code> tagged mods simply combines the effects of the <code>Delev</code> and <code>Relev</code> Bash Tags.
	<li>In addition to the above, the leveled list patcher removes any empty sublists from leveled lists, as these would otherwise cause the leveled list to select nothing if such a sublist was picked in-game.
</ul>
<p>It's best to simply ensure that your plugins have the correct tags and leave this section on automatic. To add plugins to or remove plugins from the list, uncheck the <q>Automatic</q> checkbox, and use the <q>Add</q> or <q>Remove</q> buttons. The latter will remove the currently selected plugin.
<p>To manually override the Delev/Relev Bash Tags for a plugin, right-click it in the section list and check or uncheck the relevant options as desired. To return to the automatic setting, select the <q>Auto</q> option in the right-click menu.


<h2 id="saves">Saves Tab</h2>
<figure>
<img src="bash/images/Saves.png" alt="Saves Tab"/>
<figcaption>Wrye Bash's Saves tab.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3 id="saves-overview">Overview</h3>
<p>The Saves tab allows you to manage many aspects related to your game's saves. Save files are found in the <code>My Games\[Game]\Saves</code> directory and have the file extension <code>.ess</code>. When you quicksave or autosave, the game backs up the previous quick/autosave by replacing the file extension with <code>.bak</code>. This backup may be restored by restoring its original file extension.
<p>If you have Pluggy and/or the game's Script Extender installed, each of your save files will have a corresponding <q>cosave</q> containing the Pluggy/OBSE/SKSE-specific data. These cosaves have file extensions <code>.pluggy</code>, <code>.obse</code>, <code>.skse</code> for Pluggy, OBSE and SKSE respectively.
<p>The Saves tab is divided into two sections: the main panel lists your save files and displays some of their details in its columns. The Save Details panel on the right displays some more information relating to the currently selected save file. It comprises of the following sections:
<table>
	<thead><tr><th>Section<th>Description
	<tbody>
		<tr><td>File Name<td>This is the filename of the save. Changing it here will rename the save file.
		<tr><td>Player Info<td>These three lines give the player character's name, their level, days have passed in-game, hours played and current location.
		<tr><td>O/P Flags<td> These two flags appear to the right of the player info, and indicate the presence of cosave files: O is for OBSE cosaves, and P is for Pluggy cosaves.
		<tr><td>Screenshot<td>The screenshot embedded in the save file, taken at the moment of saving.
		<tr><td>Masters List<td>The plugins that the save file depends on, and their load order.<br />
		Masters in the list can be renamed if the corresponding plugin has been renamed. To rename a master, either left-click it and edit it in the column display, or right-click it and select <q>Change To...</q> to select the desired replacement plugin from the Data directory.<br />
		Masters can also be disabled if they have been removed and are preventing your save from loading, as may sometimes happen, by right-clicking them and selecting <q>Disable</q>. Note that logical errors may still occur that prevent the removal of the plugin dependency, but this will let the game <i>try</i> to remove the dependency.
		<tr><td>Notes<td>This section can be used to keep notes on the save file.
</table>


<h3 id="saves-profiles">Save Profiles</h3>
<p>Save profiles are like player accounts, in that they consist of a load order plus a set of save files. They can be used to allow safe and easy switching between different characters than may use different combinations of mods, or between different stages of the same character's life (where different mods have been used in each stage). They can also associate different versions of Oblivion.esm with different save profiles, using <a href="tools-swapping">Oblivion.esm Swapping</a>.
<p>To create or modify save profiles, use the <a href="savesEditProfiles">Edit Profiles...</a> command in the <q>Profile</q> submenu of the column header context menu. You can create a new save profile using <q>Add</q>, delete the selected existing save profile using <q>Remove</q> and rename the selected save profile using <q>Rename</q>. The central text field can be used to store notes on the selected save profile.
<p>To select a save profile, select it from the list visible in the <q>Profile</q> submenu of the column header context menu.
<p>To assign save files to a save profile, use the <a href="#savesMoveTo">Move To</a> or <a href="#savesCopyTo">Copy To</a> submenus in the save file context menu. This will also assign any related cosave files.


<h3 id="saves-face">Face Import</h3>
<figure>
<img src="bash/images/WryeBash_03.png" alt="Face Import from Esp"/>
<figcaption>Wrye Bash's Face Import dialog.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Faces may be imported from saves to saves or plugins, or from plugins to saves. This allows you to preserve a character's appearance should you wish to restart a character, to roleplay as a particular character, or to turn your character into an NPC that may be encountered during playing, among other uses.
<p>To import a face to a save:
<ol>
	<li>Select the <a href="#savesImportFace">Import Face...</a> command in a save file's context menu. 
	<li>Choose the source save or plugin in the file dialogue that is displayed.
	<li>Choose the actor whose face you want to import. Click on a face in the list to display its details. If an image is associated with the face, it will be displayed.
	<ul>
		<li>If you chose a source plugin, the plugin's NPCs will be listed.
		<li>If you chose a source save, the player character will be at the top of the list, possibly followed by some clones of the player that the game uses for various purposes and some other NPCs.
	</ul>
	<li>Use the checkboxes to select additional characteristics to import.
	<ul>
		<li><b>The Race Import is incomplete.</b> It will change the physical appearance and identification of the character, but not the racial powers.
		<li><b>Use the Stats Import with care.</b> In-game stats are a combination of base stats, magical modifiers and scripted modifications. This command only affects the base stats. As such, the in-game effect may be negative or bizarrely high. In addition, such alteration of stats often confuses releveling mods, and such a mod may require temporary removal so that stats are imported to a save which does not have it active. Such mods can be reinstalled once the stats have been imported.
	</ul>
	<li>Click the <q>Import</q> button to finish.
</ol>
<p>To import a face to a plugin:
<ol>
	<li>Create a new plugin using the <a href="#modsNewMod">New Mod</a> command from the <q>File</q> menu of the plugin context menu in the Mods tab.
	<li>Right-click the new plugin and select <a href="#modsImportFace">Import Face...</a>.
	<li>Choose the source save in the file dialogue that is displayed.
</ol>
<p>Some notes on the usage of Face Import:

	<li>Face Import does not check for unique Editor IDs. The Construction Set will inform you of any duplicates and auto-rename them, though you will probably want to rename them manually as DUPLICATE0000 is not very informative.
	<li>If you want to associate an image with a face, save the image to <code>Data\Docs\Images\[EditorID].jpg</code>, where [EditorID] is the Editor ID of the face. The size of the image box is 250x210 pixels. Wrye Bash will scale down any image supplied to fit the box.
	<li>To tweak the stats of an existing character, try importing them to a plugin, editing them there and then importing the character back into your save file.
	<li>Normally when importing a face to a plugin, only eyes and hair from Oblivion.esm or the destination plugin will be imported. However, the following steps can be used to import eyes and hairs that come from other mods.
	<ul>
		<li>Convert the source cosmetic ESP to an ESM, using the <a href="#modsCopyToEsm">Copy to Esm</a> command in the plugin context menu in the Mods tab.
		<li>Open the destination plugin in the Construction Set, also loading the converted source cosmetic ESM.
		<li>Save the plugin in the Construction Set.
		<li>In Wrye Bash's Mods tab, select the converted source cosmetic ESM in the destination plugin's Masters List and use the <q>Change To...</q> command to select the source cosmetic ESP.
		<li>Now import the face as normal. The eyes/hair should also be imported.
	</ul>
</ul>

If one savegame is selected, then this will compare the currently active plugins to the masters of the selected savegame. The comparison details masters that have been removed and added in the newer save since the older save, or removed and added in the load order since the selected save.
		<tr><td colspan="2" id="savesStatistics">Statistics<td><i>Oblivion only.</i> This produces a set of various technical statistics for the selected savegame. The following information is produced:
			<ul>
				<li>Array sizes. These arrays are for each of the major sections in the save file.
				<li>Created items. These are items created in-game, through scripting or some sort of crafting skill (eg. alchemy, spellmaking).
				<li>Form IDs. This is a breakdown of the Form ID table in the savegame, sorted by source plugin. The Form ID table maps savegame reference numbers to the Form ID of the referenced record. If a reference is made to a record from a mod that is no longer loaded, the Form ID is replaced with a 0.
				<li>Record details. This gives a breakdown of the different types of records stored in the save file. The type is given as a number and as text (eg. <code>48 Cell</code>), and then the number of records referenced from each plugin is given below.
				<li>New ObjectRef Bases. These are objects that belong to the savegame, for example arrows dropped on the ground in-game. They generally are created and destroyed by the game as required, though bad scripting techniques can cause some of them to stick around. The "Base" of an objectRef is the baseid of the object (e.g., the formid of a steel arrow from Oblivion.esm). The objectRef refers to these indirectly through an "iref". Usually this will map back to a formid, but if the original mod has been removed from the load order, then the formid is set to zero. If this has happened, then a count of such "Null Bases" will be shown. After the "Null Base" count (if present) is a list of New ObjectRef Bases where the count is over 100 (e.g., if there are over 100 new arrows lying around). Show is the count, the iref and the base formid. Formid beginning with FF is reference to an object defined by the savegame. Otherwise, the formid will map back to a mod. The first two digits are the modindex, and can be matched to a mod through the "MI" column in the list of savegame masters.
			</ul>
		<tr><td colspan="2">.obse Statistics<td><i>Oblivion only.</i> This is similar to <a href="#savesStatistics">Statistics</a> above, but reports statistics for the .pluggy and/or .obse cosave files associated with the selected save.
		<tr><td colspan="2" id="savesDeleteSpells">Delete Spells...<td><i>Oblivion only.</i> This allows you to delete unused spells from your spell list in the selected save. <b>Warning:</b> This cannot be undone. Most spells may be repurchased or recreated, but quest and other special spells will likely have to be added using the console.
		<tr><td colspan="2">Rename Player...<td><i>Oblivion only.</i> Renames the player's character in the selected save.
		<tr><td colspan="2">Set Number of Uses for Weapon Enchantments...<td><i>Oblivion only.</i> Allows you to set the number of casts available to any enchanted weapon you created in-game, or that has otherwise been recorded in your savegame.
		<tr><td colspan="2">Import Face...<td><i>Oblivion only.</i> Relates to <a href="#saves-face">Face Importing</a>. This command allows you to import a face for the save file's player character (and possibly some NPCs) from another save file or from an NPC in a mod.
		<tr><td colspan="2">Rename Enchanted...<td><i>Oblivion only.</i> Allows you to rename any enchanted items that you have created in-game for the selected save.

		<tr><td colspan="2">Rename Spells...<td><i>Oblivion only.</i> Allows you to rename any spells that you have created in-game for the selected save.
		<tr><td colspan="2" id="savesReweighPotions">Reweigh Potions...<td><i>Oblivion only.</i> Potions created in-game are given a weight that is somewhat arbitrarily selected and potentially high. This command may be used to set all created potions to have a specific weight. Potions created after the use of this command with new names, new effects or new durations will not be affected.
		<tr><td colspan="2" id="savesUpdateNPCLevels">Update NPC Levels...<td><i>Oblivion only.</i> Updates the level information for NPCs stored in the selected savegame to reflect the active load order's NPC level settings. This is required because although NPC levels are set via plugins, once an NPC is encountered its level is stored in the save file, which overrides the plugin levels.
		<tr><td colspan="2">Export Screenshot...<td>Allows you to save the image used as the save file's screenshot as a JPEG.
		<tr><td colspan="2" id="savesRemoveBloat">Remove Bloat...<td><i>Oblivion only.</i> <b>This is an experimental command. It is recommended that saves are backed up before using it on them.</b> It attempts to determine how much bloating there is in the selected save file and then optionally remove it. If the command reports a large number of created objects, there could be a problem with one of your mods, and such mods should be removed or updated. There are two common types of bloat:
			<ul>
				<li>Excess created objects can occur through the use of scripting by a mod to duplicate existing objects in-game and a failure by the mod to clean up the duplicates after their use.
				<li>Null references are caused when objects from a mod that is removed are present in the game world. These objects then get replaced with null references when the game is next saved with the mod missing.
			</ul>
		<tr><td colspan="2" id="savesRepairAbomb">Repair Abomb<td><i>Oblivion only.</i> <q>Abomb Animation Slowing</q> is a slowing of animations that typically occurs around 225 hours into the game, though it may occur earlier or later. This is an engine bug, and this command avoids its effects by resetting a related counter (TesClass Abomb counter is reset to 0x41000000).
		<tr><td colspan="2" id="savesRepairFactions">Repair Factions<td><i>Oblivion only.</i> Attempts to repair the damage caused by a bug in <a href="#savesUpdateNPCLevels">Update NPC Levels</a> that was introduced in v105 and fixed in v116 of Wrye Bash. This also optionally updates NPC factions to reflect the faction changes by mods. <b>Do not use this function unless you know you have to.</b> It is better to revert to a recent save.
		<tr><td colspan="2">Repair Hair<td><i>Oblivion only.</i> Oblivion has a bug that will cause a crash if your PC's hair comes from a mod that has been removed and you then run showRaceMenu. This command resets your hair to the default for that race and gender, so you can then use showRaceMenu to select a new hair again if you wish.

<ul><li>For example, <code>sPhotoshopPath=;C:\Program Files\Adobe\Photoshop 7.0\Photoshop.exe</code>.</ul>
<p>You can hide some of the toggle buttons using the <code>bShowTes4...</code> options in the <code>Tool Options</code> in the <q>bash.ini</q>.

<h3 id="launchers-custom">Custom Launchers</h3>
<p>Custom launcher buttons may be added by putting a shortcut to the application you wish to have a launcher for in the <code>Mopy\Apps</code> directory. Wrye Bash will then use the following information from the shortcut:
<ul>
	<li>Icon
	<li>Working directory
	<li>Command line arguments
	<li>Comments
</ul>
<p>If you want to have a custom icon for a launcher, place a PNG image with the same name as the shortcut, appending the icon size, in the same folder. For example:
<ul>
	<li>Notepadpp.lnk
	<li>Notepadpp24.png
</ul>
<p><b>Note:</b> 24x24 icons taken from shortcuts do not work well, so if you are using this size, be sure to include a custom icon. Icon size displayed can be adjusted in the <q>bash.ini</q> or the <a href="#tools-settings">Settings</a> menu.

<p>The PM Archive tab can be used to archive, view and search Private Messages from the official Bethesda Softworks forums. Due to forum updates, messages archived since the 13th of March 2010 cannot be imported into Wrye Bash. As such, the tab is only available for legacy support of those with messages archived before then.
<p><b>Warning:</b> This feature is both experimental and outdated. Keep a separate backup of any archives you import into Wrye Bash.
<p>To import PM archives into Wrye Bash, follow the instructions below:
<ol>
	<li>Archive your PMs using the forum option, then download the HTML archive that is emailed as an attachment to you.
	<li>Rename the archive file so that the filename begins with the date the archive was created, in the format YY.MM.DD. Eg. <code>07.11.06 archive.html</code>. It doesn't matter what the name is after the date.
	<li>In Wrye Bash's PM Archives tab, right-click the box at the top and select <q>Import Archives...</q> then select the archive files you wish to import.
</ol>
<p>PMs may be searched using the bar at the bottom of the window, by entering in the search text then clicking the <q>Search</q> button or hitting return on your keyboard. Messages may be sorted by any of the columns by clicking a column header. Selecting multiple messages will display them all at once in the order they are listed.

<h3 id="people-overview">Overview</h3>
<p>The People tab functions as a simple database that can be used to keep notes on various people (eg. why you blocked a forum user, or what a good mod someone made).
<p>People are listed in the column on the left, and the large text box on the right can be used for writing notes on the selected person. Notes are saved automatically as you type them, but otherwise the text box behaves as a simple text editor such as Notepad.
<p>The Karma column displays the karma level you have set for them. Karma is a simple way of rating your disposition towards a person. The Header column displays the first 75 characters of text in a person's notes. Clicking a column header will sort by that column.

<p>Some notes on Doc Browser behaviour:
<ul>
	<li>If a plugin is renamed in the Mods tab, then any documents associated with it will become associated to the plugin's new name.
	<li>If a plugin is copied in the Mods tab, then any documents associated with it will also become associated with the copy.
	<li>Documents can be stored in any location, though <code>Data\Docs</code> is the standard location.
	<li>If you delete a plugin, its documentation will not be deleted, but it will no longer be viewable through the Doc Browser.
	<li>If you hide a plugin, its documentation will still be viewable through the Doc Browser.
</ul>


<h3 id="tools-checker">Mod Checker</h3>
<figure>
<img src="bash/images/Mod-Checker-1.png" alt="Mod Checker"/>
<figcaption>Wrye Bash's Mod Checker</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The Mod Checker checks your active and merged plugins for errors, and provides warnings for any found, as well as configuration recaps and suggestions. It can be opened by clicking the <a href="Wrye%20Bash%20General%20Readme.html#launchersModChecker">Mod Checker button</a> in the status bar.
<p>At the top of the report is the Active Mod Files section, which lists your load order. It also displays any warnings that are applicable beneath the plugin(s) that they are applicable to. These warnings are either regardinng missing masters or delinquent masters.
<ul>
	<li>Missing masters occur when a plugin that an active plugin depends on is not active. This results in an immediate CTD when the game is launched.
	<li>Delinquent masters occur when a plugin's master loads after the plugin itself. This shoud be fixed to prevent issues in-game.
</ul>
<p>The next section of the report details the output of any rulesets installed. These are text files that contain a set of instructions that tell the Mod Checker what to look for and what to say in the report if anything is found. Currently the only ruleset distributed by Wrye Bash is for Cobl. Rulesets are stored in <code>Data\Bash Patches</code> and end in <q>Rules.txt</q>. Information on ruleset syntax can be found at <a href="http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Tes4Mod:Wrye_Bash/Mod_Checker">UESP: Wrye Bash Mod Checker</a>.
<p>The rest of the report details any plugin groups that have been set up. Each group's section contains the following information:
<ul>
	<li>Notes: These are various notes on the plugin group, as entered by the user.
	<li>Configuration: This is a summary of the plugin group's configuration. It uses a few symbols to denote the status of plugins, these are: x: active; +: merged; *: imported; -: inactive/unmerged.
	<li>Suggestions: Specific suggestions for the plugin group. These are typically activating or deactivating certain plugins, or replacing mods with other mods.
	<li>Warnings: Like suggestions, but the causes are more likely to cause issues. This section will detail what should be activated or deactivated to resolve the problems.
</ul>

<h3 id="tools-swapping">Oblivion.esm Swapping</h3>
<p>Oblivion.esm swapping is a feature that allows mod authors to switch between different versions of Oblivion.esm on the fly. This is useful as it allows mod authors to make plugins that are totally SI-independent (as the Shivering Isles patches Oblivion.esm instead of using a new plugin). It can also be used to avoid the need for a fully patched Oblivion to run a plugin, but this usage is <b>not recommended</b>. If you want a plugin to work on older versions of Oblivion, use the <a href="#modsVersion0.8">Version 0.8</a> command on it.
<p>The main requirement for swapping to work is that you have the necessary copies of the different Oblivion.esm files. <b>This is only possible if you copy and rename Oblivion.esm before installing Shivering Isles.</b> There are three accepted versions of Oblivion.esm in addition to the latest SI one. These are determined by their file size:
<ul>
	<li>247388848 bytes: this is the 1.1 version. Rename it to <code>Oblivion_1.1.esm</code>.
	<li>247388812 bytes: this is the GOTY version without SI. Rename it to <code>Oblivion_GOTY non-SI.esm</code>.
	<li>247388894 bytes: this is an uncommon variant of the 1.1 version. Rename it to <code>Oblivion_1.1b.esm</code>.
</ul>
<p>You can then swap between the different versions of Oblivion.esm using the <a href="#modsOblivion.esm">Oblivion.esm</a> submenu in the Mods tab column header context menu. Your currently active version will be checked, select another to swap them. You can also perform the same swapping in the Saves tab column header context menu, but in addition to the swapping this will also mark the selected version as the preferred version to use with the current <a href="#saves-profiles">Save Profile</a>. If you then switch to another save profile and back to this one, Oblivion.esm will be swapped automatically.
<p>Wrye Bash displays the current version of Oblivion.esm in its version indicators. The main indicator is in the title bar of the main Wrye Bash window, but there are also indicators placed after Oblivion.esm in the Mods tab plugin list, and after Oblivion.esm in the Masters tab for plugins and savegames. The three possible indicators are:
<ul>
	<li>[1.1]: You are currently using the 1.1 or 1.1b version of Oblivion.esm.
	<li>[GOTY non-SI]: You are currently using the GOTY without SI installed version of Oblivion.esm.
	<li>[SI]: You are currently using the Shivering Isles-patched version of Oblivion.esm.
</ul>

<h2 id="international">Internationalisation</h2>
<h3 id="international-overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Wrye Bash has built-in support for translation into other languages, using text files that tell it which English strings in the source code should be translated, and into what. These text files are found in <code>Mopy\bash\l10n\</code>. New translations or updates to existing translations should be presented to the Wrye Bash team so that they may be included in future releases.
<p>To begin translating, or to update an existing translation, use the following steps.
<ol>
	<li>Select <a href="settingsDumpTranslator">Dump Translator</a> from Wrye Bash's Settings menu. This generates a new version of the translation file for your locale. The new file will be named appropriately, except from the leading "NEW", and will contain any translations already done.
	<li>Delete any existing translation text file for the same language.
	<li>Rename the new translator file, removing the leading "NEW". Do not change the rest of the filename.
	<li>Edit the translator file, adding translations or editing existing translations.
	<li>To test a translator file, save your changes then restart Wrye Bash, and select the language from the <a href="settingsLanguage">Language</a> submenu in Wrye Bash's Settings menu.
</ol>


<h3 id="international-format">Translator File Format</h3>
<p>Below is an excerpt from a translator file.
<code class="box">=== basher.py, 3711
Active profile cannot be removed.
>>>>

=== basher.py, 3717
Delete profile %s and the %d save files it contains?
>>>>
DELETE PROFILE %s AND THE %d SAVE FILES IT CONTAINS?
</code>
<p>The above contains two separate translation entries. Each entry begins with the source code file and line number the string to be translated is found on.
<p>The file line is followed by the original text string on a new line, which is then followed by a line containing only <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>. The translation entry ends with a final line containing the translated text string.
<p><b>Note:</b> It is important that the formatting characters are not removed or moved or added to. Formatting characters are those that start with a percentage sign or a backslash, eg. <code> %s %d %08X \n</code>. If a formatting character is missing, Wrye Bash will throw an exception, which is bad.
