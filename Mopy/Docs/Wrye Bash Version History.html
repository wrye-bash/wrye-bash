<h2>299 [2012/07/01] [Various community members]</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Fixed bug 3536117 (launcher icon error). [trira]</li>
 <li>Bash fails to reorder the UI after running BOSS. [cdcooley]</li>
 <li>Ongoing improvements to the installer system. [alt3rn1ty]</li>
 <li>New INI Tweak: Large Interiors Static Limit Fix. Prevents CTDs with mods that have large custom interiors when trying to exit to a worldspace. [Arthmoor]</li>
 <li>Updated path for GIMP in bash_default.ini for GIMP 2.8. [wrinklyninja]</li>
 <li>Updated BAPI DLLs. This update adds load order / active plugins caching. Helps with UI lag issues. [wrinklyninja]</li>
 <li>Further updates to the WizBAIN editor. [Metallicow]</li>
 <li>Bug #3535826 No spells listed in Delete Spells... [trira]</li>
 <li>Images relocated for readme files. [Metallicow]</li>
 <li>Enhancement 3400257 Startup splash screen? [alt3rn1ty]</li>
</ul>

<h2>298 [2012/06/19] [Various community members]</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Fixed load order bug that occurred when renaming a plugin. [trira]
 <li>Some more UI responsiveness improvements. [cdcooley]
 <li>Fixed BAIN's <q>Skip Docs</q> option causing Interface files to be skipped when running for Skyrim. [WrinklyNinja]
 <li>Fixed Wrye Bash reverting its own load order changes when <q>Lock Load Order</q> is enabled. [cdcooley, WrinklyNinja]
 <li>Some more installer improvements. [Alt3rn1ty]
 <li>Fixed <q>Espify/Esmify Self</q> not refreshing the load order display. [cdcooley]
 <li>Fixed BAIN's <q>Clean Data</q> command removing some Bethesda-supplied files. [Daidalos, WrinklyNinja]
 <li>Added some UI feedback messages for certain plugin-related situations where Wrye Bash would previously silently prevent user action (eg. deleting the main master file, loading plugins before masters). [WrinklyNinja]
 <li>Fixed Wrye Bash not ensuring plugins.txt / loadorder.txt synchronisation when it regains window focus. [cdcooley]
 <li>Removed the <q>Lock Load Order</q> command when running for Skyrim, as this functionality is effectively taken care of by the above synchronisation fix. When running for Skyrim, Wrye Bash will now allow any changes to load order that are made in accordance with the textfile-based standard (eg. changes by BOSS, NMM), but revert any other changes made (eg. changes by the Skyrim launcher). This is to ensure data integrity. [Arthmoor]

 <li>Fixed bug in <q>Create BOSS Report</q>. [bluesky404]
 <li>Fixed Wrye Bash not removing plugins deleted through the Mods tab UI from plugins.txt and loadorder.txt (the latter in Skyrim only). [WrinklyNinja]
 <li>Updated the included BOSS API DLLs to the latest development version.  [WrinklyNinja]
 <li>Updated the taglist files used by Wrye Bash if it cannot detect a BOSS install.  [WrinklyNinja]
 <li>Fixed slideshows in General and Advanced Readmes not working in Internet Explorer. [WrinklyNinja]
 <li>Improved performance of Bash Tag reading and storage. [Daidalos]
 <li>More updates to the WizBAIN Editor. These changes are not yet documented. [Metallicow]
 <li>Fixed building an inactive Bashed Patch causing an error message. [Daidalos]
 <li>Fixed activating a Bashed Patch through the post-build dialog not updating the UI to reflect this. [Daidalos]
</ul>

<ul>
 <li>More updating of all Nexus URLs to their new formats. [Arthmoor]

 <li>Various improvements for the WizBAIN Editor. [Metallicow]
 <li>Fixed load order being read incorrectly when Auto-Ghost was enabled. [WrinklyNinja]
 <li>Fixed Bash not opening due to datetime error. [Trira/Metallicow]
 <li>Added <q>Create New Project</q> dialog to Installers tab. [Metallicow]
 <li>Fixed Bash loading the BOSS API DLLs that are included with BOSS even if they are older than the DLLs included with Bash. [WrinklyNinja]
 <li>Fixed installer's URL for PyWin32 being invalid. [Alt3rn1ty]
 <li>Some more attempts at improving UI responsiveness. [cdcooley]

 <li>Updated Russian translation. [Djk]
 <li>Fixed error that sometimes occurred when trying to deactivate a plugin. [cdcooley]
</ul>

 <li>Improved support for launching Skyrim's creation kit: Bash now displays the correct icon and supplies the correct launch parameters.
 <li>Moved default patchers and ini tweaks for Oblivion and Skyrim into the Mopy folder: user-installed patchers and tweaks will continue to go in their folders within each game's Data folder.
 <li>Fixed applying INI Tweaks via the "Apply" choice.
 <li>Fixed BAIN skipping the Data\Docs folder of packages when running for Skyrim.
 <li>Fixed BAIN skipping SkyUI files when <q>Skip Docs</q> was enabled.

			<li>Sexless Hairs
		</ul>
		<li>Globals Patcher has been merge into Tweak Settings.

</ul>
 
<h2>295.5 [2012/01/17] [Lojack,PacificMorrowind]</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Bugfix release:
	<ul>
		<li>Skyrim: Corrected more record definitions.  All record definitions have been double checked now.
		<li><a href="Wrye%20Bash%20General%20Readme.html#bain">BAIN</a>: Fixed a problem associated with Embedded BCFs, causing BAIN to become unusable.
		<li>Wrye Bash Installer updated to included the necessary files of the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=14431">MSVC 2005 SP1 Redistributable with ATL Security Update</a>.  These files are required on Windows XP for 7zUnicode.exe to run.  These files are not included in the Manual Install archives - users should install the redistributable package from Microsoft for manual installs.
		<li>Wrye Bash Uninstaller updated to remove some files it was missing.
		<li>Changed how the 'Apps' folder launchers are used, to work with Unicode better.
		<li>Fixed a problem with restarting Wrye Bash.  Specifically, the Standalone version would shutdown instead of restart, when required.

		<li>Better printing of error messages on startup, when using the Standalone version.
		<li>Corrected a problem with <a href="Wrye%20Bash%20General%20Readme.html#ini">INI Tweaks</a> where adding new lines sometimes would not write the whole line.
		<li>Made an adjustment to <a href="Wrye%20Bash%20Advanced%20Readme.html#saves-profiles">Save Profiles</a>, that should help out when the Profile name has Unicode in it.
	</ul>
</ul>

<h2>295.4 [2012/01/15] [Lojack,PacificMorrowind]</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Bugfix release:
	<ul>
		<li>Skyrim: Corrected the record definitions for LVLI, LVLN, LVSP, MISC, ARMO, and ARMA records.
		<li><a href="Wrye%20Bash%20General%20Readme.html#patch">Bashed Patch</a>:
		<ul>
			<li>Small tweak to Leveled Lists patcher, allowing changes to the Flags of a list to be imported in rare occasions where they were not.
			<li>Reverted the change to the Graphics patcher from 295.3, mods requiring the model file name to be imported should be using the <code>Actors.Skeleton</code> <a href="Wrye%20Bash%20Advanced%20Readme.html#patch-tags">Tag</a> to accomplish this.
		</ul>
		<li>Fixed <a href="Wrye%20Bash%20General%20Readme.html#ini">INI Tweaks</a> that un-deleted a tweak line.  Now instead of re-adding the tweak in as a new line, the original line will correctly be replaced.
		<li>Fixed an issue with switching <a href="Wrye%20Bash%20Advanced%20Readme.html#saves-profiles">Save Game profiles</a>, that was introduced due to the new INI Tweak changes.
		<li>Fixed an issue where <a href="Wrye%20Bash%20General%20Readme.html#bain">BAIN</a> would sometimes install document files from inactive packages.
		<li>Updated the Wrye Bash Installer with some typo fixes, and to correctly remove some files associated with newer versions of Wrye Bash when required.
		<li>Fixed a bug causing Wrye Bash to never ask to backup your settings on an upgrade.
	</ul>
</ul>

<h2>295.3 [2012/01/14] [Lojack,bluesky404,PacificMorrowind]</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Major Unicode rewrite!  Everything has been gone through to make Wrye Bash works with Unicode file names and characters:
	<ul>
		<li>Special thanks to __bluesky404__ for a ton of work testing, debugging, and providing patches to help make this possible.
		<li>By default when reading plugins, Wrye Bash first tries to interpret the data as 'Western European'.  This includes languages such as English, French, German, Spanish, and Italian.  Some languages this does ~~not~~ cover are Russian and Asian languages (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, etc).
		<ul>
			<li>To modify this behavior, there is a new setting, accessible via the <a href="Wrye%20Bash%20Advanced%20Readme.html#tools-settings">Setting Menu</a>, Plugin Encoding.  This would be used if you have a plugin with Chinese, Russian, or other languages that don't fall under the 'Western European' encoding.
			<li>This is a global setting, so changing it will have an effect on ~~all~~ plugins.
			<li>Changing this setting won't be immediately obvious on the Mods Tab, as the data isn't updated unless it is read from file again.  However, the change will effect Bashed Patch creation and the mod file Import/Export commands immediately.
			<li>Changing this setting to Automatic will have the best result all around, but due to the extra processing involved in Automatic mode, it is not enabled by default.  In one example, Bashed Patch creation time went from about 15 minutes with a specified encoding, to 22 minutes with Automatic encoding.
		</ul>
		<li>Some minor inconsistencies might be observed, specifically when viewing the Author or Description field on mods, or viewing the Name or Location of a saved game.  Wrye Bash tries its best to detect the encoding of strings, and makes some educated guesses based off that, but sometimes it will just get it wrong.  When this happens, the displayed text might show up as random characters from another language.
		<li>Unicode file names are fully supported.
		<li>Limitations:
		<ul>
			<li>Skyrim and Oblivion have problems with reading the 'plugins.txt' file when there are unicode file names in it.  Therefore, we cannot guarantee that activated plugins with Unicode file names will actually be loaded.
			<li>Files specific to Wrye Bash for input must be formatted in UTF-8 (with or without BOM).  This means any .txt files utilizing Wrye Bash's wtxt format, any .csv files used as input for the Bashed Patch, and BAIN wizard.txt files.
			<li>The masterlist.txt and userlist.txt files for BOSS are expected to also be in UTF-8 format.  This is a requirement imposed by BOSS, so no change should be noticed there.
		</ul>
		<li><a href="Wrye%20Bash%20General%20Readme.html#international">Translation files</a> format has changed.  Old translation files have been converted to the new format.
	</ul>
	<li>More refactoring for multi-game support.
	<li>New Skyrim features:
	<ul>
		<li>Support for AACT, ACTI, ADDN, AMMO, ARMA, ARMO, COBJ, GLOB, GMST, LVLI, LVLN, LVSP, and MISC records added.
		<li>Merge support for AACT, AMMO, ARMA, ARMO, COBJ, GLOB, GMST, LVLI, LVLN, LVSP, and MISC added.
		<li>Basic ONAM support for TES4 records.
		<li><a href="Wrye%20Bash%20Advanced%20Readme.html#patch-tags">Bashed Tags</a>:
		<ul>
			<li><a href="Wrye%20Bash%20Advanced%20Readme.html#patch-lists">Delev and Relev</a> - These can be used to intelligently merge leveled lists.
			<li><a href="Wrye%20Bash%20Advanced%20Readme.html#patch-filter">Filter</a>, NoMerge, and Deactivate - These can be used to modify behavior in regards merging and importing records.
		</ul>
		<li>Better merging of records with NULL Form IDs, for records that allow it (COBJ and GMST for example).
		<li>New <a href="Wrye%20Bash%20General%20Readme.html#bain">BAIN</a> option: <a href="Wrye%20Bash%20Advanced%20Readme.html#bain-commands">Auto-name String Translation files</a>:
		<ul>
			<li>Will automatically rename .STRINGS, .DLSTRINGS, and .ILSTRINGS files to the correct language for your game, but only if the installer does not already contain String Translation files for your language.
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<li>Bugfixes:
	<ul>
		<li>An uncommon Drag and Drop of Tabs related bug is fixed (relating to Mouse Capture).
		<li><a href="Wrye%20Bash%20Advanced%20Readme.html#savesListMasters">List Masters</a> command corrected to display the masters of a Save File, rather than the current Load Order.
		<li>Startup crash when the Installers Tab is hidden and 'Avoid at Startup' is selected for the Installers Tab corrected.
		<li>Startup crash when Skyrim.esm was ghosted, and set to be inactive within Wrye Bash.
		<li>Fixed an issue where the <a href="Wrye%20Bash%20General%20Readme.html#patchImportGraphics">Graphics</a> tag was not properly importing the model file name on CREA records.
	</ul>
	<li>Removed support for Skyrim's 4gb Launcher, as a recent patch makes this obsolete.
	<li>Updated the Wrye Bash Installer to check for Unicode versions of wxPython, and only accept Python 2.7 (no more 2.6 or 2.5 support).
	<li>Other improvements:
	<ul>
		<li>New Simplified Chinese translation, provided by bluesky404.
		<li>New Traditional Chinese translation, provided by bluesky404.
		<li><a href="Wrye%20Bash%20General%20Readme.html#bain">BAIN</a>:
		<ul>
			<li>Wizard.txt and readmes will no longer show up as 'Skipped' if it's in an odd directory.
			<li>New "Embedded BCFs" - If an archive contains a BCF, Wrye Bash can apply that BCF directly to the containing archive.  If the BAIN option 'Auto-Apply Embedded BCFs' is selected, BAIN will do this automatically.
			<li>The Open At Skyrim Nexus and Open At TES Nexus commands will detect files with File IDs less than 4 digits now.
		</ul>
		<li><a href="Wrye%20Bash%20General%20Readme.html#ini">INI Edits</a>:
		<ul>
			<li>Double click to apply an INI Tweak
			<li>Left Click on the checkbox to apply an INI Tweak
			<li>INI Tweaks can now add and remove new lines to target INIs.
			<ul>
				<li>Adding lines is only enabled if the 'Allow Tweaks with New Lines' option is enabled (disabled by default for Oblivion, enabled by default for Skyrim).
			</ul>
			<li>The syntax for denoting a line to be deleted is to prepend the line with ";-".
			<li>BAIN Wizards can also create "deleted" INI Tweak lines, via the <a href="Wrye%20Bash%20Technical%20Readme.html#DisableINILine">DisableINILine</a> command.
		</ul>
		<li>Better support for Mac Command button.
		<li><a href="Wrye%20Bash%20Advanced%20Readme.html#patch">Bashed Patch</a>:
		<ul>
			<li>New <a href="Wrye%20Bash%20General%20Readme.html#patchTweakAssorted">Assorted Tweaker</a>: No Description Loading Screens (requested by hellwing).
		</ul>
		<li>Wrye Bash will ask to backup your settings on ~~every~~ update now, instead of just a major version update (like from 294 to 295).
		<li>Quickly switching between games can be accomplished via the <a href="Wrye%20Bash%20Advanced%20Readme.html#tools-settings">Settings Menu</a>.
	</ul>
</ul>

<h2>295.2 [2011/12/02] [Lojack,bluesky404,Metallicow]</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Bugfixes:
	<ul>
	  <li><a href="Wrye%20Bash%20Advanced%20Readme.html#bain">Installers Tab</a>:
	  <ul>
		<li>Fixed the 'List Sub-Packages' command.
		<li>Fixed installation of Script Extender plugins when not in Oblivion game mode.
		<li>Fixed a refresh bug where changing the install order via Ctrl+Up or Ctrl+Down would not refresh the need to Anneal packages.
		<li>Fixed an incorrect color being used for packages that need Annealing.  Previously a light gray background color was used to indicate a package has underrides that need to be corrected by Annealing.  Now BAIN correctly uses a yellow background, as described in this readme.
	</ul>
	  <li>Fixed Save Profiles so they work even when the game's INI file doesn't initially have the 'sLocalSavePath' entry (ie: Skyrim).
	  <li>Fixed the 'Check for Updates' option while running in Standalone mode.
	  <li>Fixed the spelling on the German Wizard Image
	  </ul>
	<li>New features:
	<ul>
	  <li>4Gb/LAA Launcher supported:
		<li>For games that have a LAA Launcher (Skyrim currently), launching the game will launch via the LAA Launcher.
		<li>A new <a href="Wrye%20Bash%20General%20Readme.html#launchers-toggles">status bar button</a> for enabling/disabling the LAA Launcher.
	  <li>Added Status Bar mouse over texts for BAIN Packages.
	  <li>BAIN will silently ignore the "config" file that NMM places into downloaded packages.
	</ul>
	<li>Skyrim specific:
	<ul>
	  <li>Basic editing of Save Games:
	  <ul>
		<li>Masters
		</ul>
	  <li>Basic editing of Mod files:
	  <ul>
		<li>Author
		<li>Description
		<li>Masters
	</ul>
	  <li>Bashed Patches:
	  <ul>
		<li>Can merge GMST, GLOB, AMMO, and COBJ records.

	</ul>
</ul>

<h2>295.1 [2011/11/27] [Lojack,Waruddar,myk002,PaificMorrowind]</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Skyrim support added:
<ul>
	  <li>Can read basic information from Skyrim mods (author and description)
	  <li>Can read basic save game information (player name, level, play time)
	  <li>Can modify your Load Order
<ul>
		<li>Update.esm will show up in the Load Order as unselected initially.  Skyrim treats this mod specially, and always loads it directly after Skyrim.esm.  Changings it's load order and activation status should have no effect on the game.
</ul>
	  <li><a href="Wrye%20Bash%20Advanced%20Readme.html#bain">BAIN</a> is supported, including the standard directories and SKSE plugins.
</ul>
	<li>UI Improvements:
<ul>
	  <li>Customizible Status Bar and Tabs:
<ul>
		<li>Drag and drop reordering
		<li>Hideable
</ul>
</ul>
	<li>Bugfixes:
<ul>
	  <li>Fixed a few <a href="Wrye%20Bash%20General%20Readme.html#ini">INI Edits</a> tab related startup crashes.
	  <li>More information should be displayed when Wrye Bash fails to startup.
	  <li>More information is displayed in debug mode when a Tab fails to initialize.
	  <li>Fixed a crash on startup bug when no plugins are found in the Data directory.
</ul>
	<li><a href="Wrye%20Bash%20Technical%20Readme.html#wizards">BAIN Wizards</a>:
<ul>
	  <li>New function <a href="Wrye%20Bash%20Technical%20Readme.html#wizardsCompareGameVersion">CompareGameVersion</a> replaces the older <a href="Wrye%20Bash%20Technical%20Readme.html#wizardsCompareObVersion">CompareObVersion</a>.  The older function is retained for backwards compatibility only.

</ul>
	<li>Changes to the installation requirements:
<ul>
	  <li>You may still install Wrye Bash to "path.to.you.game\Mopy" as before, and it will function normally.
	  <li>You may also install Wrye Bash to any other location.  In that case, here is how it will decide what game to manage:
<ul>
		<li>Read the Windows Registry to see what supported games you have installed.
		<li>Also check one directory up relative to Wrye Bash to see if it contains a supported game.
		<li>If only one supported game is detected:  Wrye Bash will manage that game.
		<li>If multiple supported games are detected:
<ul>
		  <li>If the '-g' command line argument is used, Wrye Bash will manage the game specified by '-g'.
		  <li>If the '-o' command line argument is specified, Wrye Bash will manage the game in the location specified by '-o'.
		  <li>If Wrye Bash is installed as a sub-directory to a detected game, Wrye Bash will manage that game.
		  <li>Finally, Wrye Bash will display a prompt asking which game to manage.
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
	<li>New command line argument '-g' or '--game'.  Used to specify which game Wrye Bash should manage.  For example, using:
<ul>
	  <li><code><span style="color:brown;">"Wrye Bash.exe"</span> -<i>g</i> <i>oblivion</i></code>
	  <li>Will tell Wrye Bash to manage your Oblivion installation.

<ul>
	<li>Many thanks to Arthmoor, silverbluemoon, Zoar5, GabaZieute, and VKS, who contributed their time, gave us feedback, and beta tested solutions for several difficult bugs.  It's community members like you that help Wrye Bash succeed!
	<li>First-run Usability Improvements:
<ul>
	  <li>Default options and widget sizes have been revamped for a smoother first-time experience
	  <li>More startup errors are shown in a popup messagebox instead of just being dumped to the log
	  <li>Default window sizes have been increased so you can actually see their contents on first load
	  <li>Debug .bat file now works for all supported Python versions and all Python installation paths instead of being hardcoded to look for c:/Python27
	  <li>Wrye Bash can now be started from any directory instead of requiring Mopy as the working directory
</ul>
	<li><a href="Wrye%20Bash%20Advanced%20Readme.html#patch">Bashed Patch</a>:
<ul>
	  <li>Usability improvements:
<ul>
		<li>Mods with tags that are being bashed for the first time will now automatically be checked and bolded in the bashed patch dialog.
		<li>Corresponding patchers will be automatically enabled and bolded.
		<li>If you would rather do things manually, you can turn the new autocheck behavior off in the ini.
		<li>When you enable a mod or tweak in a patcher, the corresponding patcher is now auto-checked (always on: not controlled by the ini).
</ul>
	  <li>Assorted tweakers:
<ul>
		<li>New tweak: Skyrim-style Weapons.

	  <li>File-><a href="Wrye%20Bash%20Advanced%20Readme.html#modsNewBashedPatch">New Bashed Patch</a> will generate a new, empty bashed patch with the next name in the sequence (Bashed Patch, 1.esp, etc.)

</ul>

This allows you to change what colors Wrye Bash uses for various informational purposes.  This only configures the custom colors that Wrye Bash uses.  Anything else uses your system defaults, so if you want to change those, you'll need to do it through your OS.
	<li>Save->Edit Spells will now work with corrupted/malformed/unexpectedly formed mod files; will just skip those mod files rather than fatally choking (and if in debug mode will say the mod is skipped and why).
	<li><a href="Wrye%20Bash%20Advanced%20Readme.html#launchers-custom">Custom launcher buttons</a> now support launching of msi created shortcuts.

<li>Fix so that it is impossible to open multiple copies of Wrye Bash at the same.
