<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
<p>Wrye Bash is a powerful mod management utility for TES IV: Oblivion and TES V: Skyrim. Its features include:
<ul>
    <li>A mod installation and conflict manager
    <li>A plugin load order manager
    <li>Increased mod compatibility
    <li>Lifting of the 255 plugin limit through automatic merging of compatible mods
    <li>.ini and settings files tweak management
    <li>Screenshot management
    <li>Many, many more features
</ul>
<p>Wrye Bash can appear daunting at first. To help make it more manageable, the documentation has been split into a few readmes that are targeted towards different usage requirements.
<p>A companion to the <a href="Wrye%20Bash%20General%20Readme.html">General Readme</a>, this document details those features that were omitted from the aforementioned readme. These features are often more specialised, advanced or complicated, and many area geared more towards mod authors than mod users. This readme is also more technical and goes into more depth on how Wrye Bash functions. It assumes the reader has previously read the General Readme.
<p>Note that the <a href="#people">People</a> and <a href="#pm">PM Archive</a> tabs are hidden by default. You can toggle the visibility of the tabs in Wrye Bash's main tab bar by right-clicking the tab bar and checking or unchecking the options in the context menu displayed.

<h3 id="intro-title">Title Bar Info</h3>
<p>As a quick note that doesn't really belong anywhere else, Wrye Bash's title bar contains some useful information. The title is formatted as:
<p><code>Wrye Bash [Bash Version] [Install Type] [Game Modifier], Cbash v[CBash Version]: [Save Profile] [Version Indicator]</code>
<p>The square bracketed information is:
<ul>
	<li><code>[Bash Version]</code>: This is the version number for the version of Wrye Bash running. Useful when troubleshooting.
	<li><code>[Install Type]</code>: If the Python version is running, this will read <q>Python</q>. If the Standalone version is running, it will read <q>(Standalone)</q>. See the <a href="#install">Installation</a> section for more information.
	<li><code>[Game Modifier]</code>: If the option is selected in the <a href="Wrye%20Bash%20Advanced%20Readme.html#tools-settings">Settings menu</a>, this will display <q>for Oblivion</q> or <q>for Skyrim</q> depending on the game it is being run for.
	<li><code>[CBash Version]</code>: This is the version number for the version of CBash included with the Wrye Bash install. Useful when troubleshooting. See the <a href="#patch">Setting Up A Bashed Patch</a> section for more information.
	<li><code>[Save Profile]</code>: This is the name of the <a href="Wrye%20Bash%20Advanced%20Readme.html#saves-profile">save profile</a> Wrye Bash is currently using. By default it is <q>Default</q>.
	<li><code>[Version Indicator]</code>: This is only displayed when Wrye Bash is running for Oblivion. It indicates the version of Oblivion.esm currently being used. This is related to the <a href="Wrye%20Bash%20Advanced%20Readme.html#tools-swapping">Oblivion.esm Swapping</a> feature.
</ul>

<h2 id="install">Advanced Installation</h2>
<h3 id="install-alternate">Alternative Install Locations</h3>
<p>Wrye Bash can be installed in any folder, but if it is installed outside of the game's folder, then the OblivionPath bash.ini option must be adjusted.
<p>To do so:
<ol>
    <li>Open <code>bash_default.ini</code> in the <code>Mopy</code> folder and save it as <code>bash.ini</code>.
    <li>In the new bash.ini, enter the full path of your game's installation folder (the one that contains the game's executable) for the <q>sOblivionPath</q> setting.
    <li>Save the edited bash.ini.
</ol>
<p>Alternatively, you can launch Wrye Bash with the -o argument, quoting the path as the argument's parameter. Note that backslashes must be doubled as Python treats a single backslash as an escape character. For example, <code>"Wrye Bash Launcher.pyw" -o "C:\\Games\\Oblivion\\"</code> if you are running Wrye Bash for Oblivion.


<h3 id="install-components">Python Components</h3>
<p>If you are installing the Python version of Wrye Bash and wish to install the Python dependencies separately, the following must be installed.
<p style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;font-size:1em;color:red;">Note that the 32-bit versions are required even if you are on a 64-bit operating system.</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.8/python-2.7.8.msi">Python 2.7.8</a>.  If you are already using 2.7.3 or higher, updating to the latest version is not required.  Versions prior to 2.7.3 may work with Wrye Bash, but have not been tested.  Updating is recommended for bug and security fixes.
    <li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/wxpython/files/wxPython/2.8.12.1/wxPython2.8-win32-unicode-2.8.12.1-py27.exe">wxPython 2.8.12.1 Unicode for Python 2.7</a>
    <li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/Build%20219/pywin32-219.win32-py2.7.exe/download">PyWin32</a>: This component is required for Wizards to function. If you do not wish to use Wizards, then it need not be installed.
    <li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/comtypes/files/comtypes/0.6.2/comtypes-0.6.2.win32.exe/download">Comtypes 0.6.2</a>: This is an optional component, it is used to enable rendering of HTML via an ActiveX control.  The  following features are affected if comtypes is not installed:
        <ul>
            <li>The PM Archives tab will be disabled.
            <li>The DocBrowser will display raw text when displaying an HTML readme.
            <li>The ModChecker report will be text instead of HTML.
            <li>The Bashed Patch build report will be displayed by opening the file in your default browser.
        </ul>
</ul>

<h2 id="bain">Installers Tab</h2>
<h3 id="bain-ui">The User Interface In Detail</h3>
<p>The Installers tab is split into three main sections: on the left is the Package List, and the right is split between the Information Tabs at the top and the Comments field at the bottom. The Information Tabs and Comments sections display information specific to the currently selected package. Much of the contents of the Information Tabs depends on the install status and order of the package. The information tabs are detailed in the table below.
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr><th colspan="2">Information Tabs
        <tr><th>Tab<th>Description
    <tbody>
        <tr><td>General<td>Shows summary info and the files to be installed, as determined by sub-package, esp/m, voice filtering, etc.
        <tr><td>Matched<td>Shows files which are identical to current Data directory files.
        <tr><td>Missing<td>Files which are missing from the Data directory.
        <tr><td>Mismatched<td>Files which are present in the data directory, but which aren't identical to the selected package's version of those files.
        <tr><td>Conflicts<td>Shows which other packages will conflict the current package and for what files. Note that if a given file is mismatched, but the mismatch isn't due to other packages, then it won't appear. This report can be modified to show inactive conflicts and lower order conflicts by enabling the <a href="#bainShowInactiveConflicts">Show Inactive Conflicts</a> and <a href="#bainShowLowerConflicts">Show Lower Conflicts</a> options respectively.
        <tr><td>Underidden<td>Shows packages which should be overridden, but are not, due to install order errors. This can be corrected by running <a href="#bainAnneal">Anneal</a> or <a href="#bainAnnealAll">Anneal All</a>.
        <tr><td>Dirty<td>Shows files which the selected package previously installed, but which now should be removed or altered due to a reconfiguration of the package. Dirty files can be cleared by running <a href="#bainAnneal">Anneal</a> or <a href="#bainAnnealAll">Anneal All</a>.
        <tr><td>Skipped<td>Shows which files in the selected package were <a href="#bain-skipped">skipped</a> by Bain.
</table>
<p>The Comments field is provided as an area in which notes may be kept on packages. It is useful for keeping track of what packages do, what your favourite install options are, etc.

<h3 id="bain-skipped">Skipped Files</h3>
<p>BAIN skips the installation of some files and directories. The types of files skipped are:
<ul>
    <li>Silent skips. These are thumbs.db files, and the omod conversion directory and its subfiles.
    <li>Developer files. Any file or directory that begins with '--' and is at the top level of a package or a subpackage will be silently skipped. This is so that mod authors can include files related to a mod that are not required for it to work (eg. screenshots) in packages.
    <li>Non-standard directories. Standard directories include all the game's default directories (including those only found in BSAs by default) and 'ini', ini tweaks', 'pluggy', 'scripts', 'streamline' and '_tejon'. Installation of these directories may be forced by using the <a href="#bainHasExtraDirectories">Has Extra Directories</a> option. Files skipped because of this will be listed in the <q>Skipped</q> panel on the right.
    <li>Archives &amp; executables. Executable files, apart from Script Extender plugins if the <a href="#bainSkipOBSEPlugins">Skip OBSE Plugins</a> option is disabled, and archives in packages will be skipped. Files skipped because of this will be listed in the <q>Skipped</q> panel on the right.
    <li>Specified skips. There are a few options in BAIN to skip the installation of certain file types. If any such options are enabled, the file type(s) in question will be skipped.
</ul>


<h3 id="bain-se">Script Extender Plugin Installation</h3>
<p>Script Extender (OBSE, SKSE) plugins (.dll, .dlx extensions) may be installed through BAIN if the following conditions are met:
<ul>
    <li>The package or subpackage containing the OBSE plugin has it in <code>OBSE\Plugins</code> (for Oblivion), <code>SKSE\Plugins</code> (for Skyrim) or a subfolder of the same.
    <li>The <a href="#bainSkipOBSEPlugins">Skip OBSE Plugins</a> option found in the Installers tab column header context menu is disabled.
</ul>
<p>When attempting to install a specific Script Extender plugin for the first time, Wrye Bash will display a warning dialogue and ask you to confirm or deny the plugin's installation. Thereafter you can uninstall and install the plugin as you like without seeing the warning. These additional requirements are due to the significant (though currently theoretical) dangers of installing executable files.
<p>The list of allowed and disallowed Script Extender plugins can be imported and exported using the <a href="#settingsImportList">Import list of allowed/disallowed OBSE plugin dlls</a> and <a href="#settingsExportList">Export list of allowed/disallowed OBSE plugin dlls</a> options in Wrye Bash's <a href="#settings">Settings</a> menu.


<h3 id="bain-omod">OMOD Conversion Data</h3>
<p>If a mod author is building a mod that supports BAIN, manual and OMOD installs, they can use the <a href="#bainOmodInfo">Omod Info...</a> option in the package context menu to create or update the OMOD config file.
<p>If a mod author wishes to include a screenshot for use by the OMOD, they simply need to copy the screenshot saved as a JPEG to the OMOD Conversion Data folder and rename it to <q>screenshot</q> with no file extension.
<p>An OMOD installation script may also be created by creating a text file named <q>script.txt</q> and writing the script in any text editor. Testing is still best done in OBMM though.
<p>The OMOD config file is the only true requirement for an OMOD to be created from OMOD Conversion Data. The screenshot and installation script can be used to enhance an OMOD. Note that the <q>info.txt</q> file that OMODs create when exporting Conversion Data in OBMM is unnecessary, and is provided for purely informational purposes.


<h3 id="bain-bcf">BAIN Conversion Files</h3>
<p><abbr title="BAIN Conversion Files">BCFs</abbr> are effectively automated archive converters, converting an existing archive or several archives into a new layout. They can be used to make BAIN-incompatible archives compatible, or make compatible archives easier to install. As they don't contain any files that are found in the existing archive(s), the only copyright/permissions that apply are those that the BCF creator stipulates, which generally makes distribution easier. BCFs are also usually much smaller, only containing new files that it adds (commonly <q>package.txt</q> and ini file tweaks) and a <q>BCF.dat</q> that tells Wrye Bash how to reorganise the archive(s).
<p>To create a BCF:
<ol>
    <li>Add all of the source archives to BAIN.
    <li>Create a new project with the contents of the source archives, and rearrange the files as you see fit.
    <li>Right-click the project and select <a href="#bainPackToArchive">Pack To Archive...</a>.
    <li>Name the new archive, and choose whether to use solid compression or not. Solid compression results in smaller file sizes, but also reduces performance.
    <li>Set any options on the new archive package that you wish to be set whenever the BCF is applied (such as default sub-packages or <q>Skip...</q> options).
    <li>Select all the source archives in the package list, then right-click them and choose <a href="#modsConversionsCreate">Conversions->Create</a>. Select the archive that you just created, and name the BCF.
    <li>Look over the result log to make sure it looks OK. If it looks wrong, try again, you may have gotten the sources/target wrong. If it looks right, you can find the new BCF in <code>[Game] Mods\Bash Installers\Bain Converters</code>. It is recommended that you copy/paste the result log into your readme for your BCF.
</ol>
<p>Some points of interest regarding BCFs:
<ul>
    <li>BCFs must end in either <code>-BCF.7z</code> or <code>-BCF-*.7z</code> (where the * is a wildcard matching any character string).
    <li>The converted archive may use 7-zip (.7z) or Zip (.zip) compression.
    <li>BCFs support an arbitrary number and level of archives embedded within an archive.
    <li>BCFs store the configuration settings of the original converted archive used when creating the BCF, allowing authors to pre-select options (see instructions above).
    <li>BCFs found to be duplicates will be moved to <code>[Game] Mods\Bash Installers\Bain Converters\--Duplicates</code>.
    <li>BCFs use data CRCs to verify the integrity of source archives. These use the contents of an archive, but not the name or type of the archive, so a source archive may be renamed or recompressed without affecting its ability to be used by a BCF. Wrye Bash displays the data CRCs of packages on the General Info tab for this reason.
</ul>


<h3 id="bain-commands">Context Menu Commands</h3>
<p>The tables below detail the full list of context menu commands available in the Installers tab.
<table id="bainHeaderCommands">
    <thead>
        <tr><th colspan="3">Column Header Context Menu
        <tr><th colspan="2">Command<th>Description
    <tbody>
        <tr><td rowspan="7" id="bainSortBy">Sort By<td>Sort By Active<td>Active installers will be sorted to the top.

        <tr><td>Package<td>Sort packages by package name.
        <tr><td>Order<td>Sort packages by install order.
        <tr><td>Modified<td>Sort packages by date modified.
        <tr><td>Size<td>Sort packages by size.
        <tr><td>Files<td>Sort packages by number of files they contain.

        <tr><td colspan="2" id="bainRefreshData">Refresh Data<td>Re-scans the Data directory and all project directories. This is done once per run of Wrye Bash, when the Installers tab is first opened. If you manually alter the directories after that, you should run this command to update BAIN to reflect the changes.
        <tr><td colspan="2" id="bainFullRefresh">Full Refresh<td>This does a full refresh of all data files. Notably this will recalculate CRCs for all files (ordinarily CRCs are only calculated for files that seem to have changed). Running this command will likely take 5-15 minutes.
        <tr><td colspan="2" id="bainAddMarker">Add Marker...<td>Creates a marker for organising your packages. The <q>==</q> will be added for you.
        <tr><td colspan="2" id="bainCreateNewProject">Create New Project...<td>Displays a dialog that allows you to create a new project and select some starting files for it.
		<tr><td colspan="2" id="bainMonitorExternalInstallation">Monitor External Installation...<td>When you absolutely cannot install a mod via BAIN, you can put BAIN into Monitor Mode using this command.  It will scan the Data folder before and after you install the mod, then provide an option to create a Project from the changes it detects.
        <tr><td colspan="2" id="bainListPackages">List Packages...<td>Displays a list of projects and archives and copies the list to your clipboard. This is useful for posting your package order on forums, eg. when troubleshooting an install.
        <tr><td colspan="2" id="bainAnnealAll">Anneal All<td>Installs any missing files for active installers and corrects all install order errors.
        <tr><td colspan="2" id="bainUnhide">Unhide...<td>Opens a dialogue window allowing you to select which hidden packages to unhide.
        <tr><td colspan="2" id="bainUninstallAll">Uninstall All Packages<td>Uninstalls all the packages in the package list.
        <tr><td colspan="2" id="bainCleanData">Clean Data<td>Removes files from the Data folder that are not from one of the following sources:
            <ul>
                <li>Vanilla game content.
                <li>Official DLC content.
                <li>Wrye Bash.
                <li>Installed BAIN packages.
            </ul>
        The files are not deleted, but moved to the <code>[Game] Mods\Bash Installers\Bash\Data Folder Contents [timestamp]</code> folder instead, where <code>[timestamp]</code> is the date and time the command was run.
        <tr><td colspan="2" id="bainAvoidAtStartup">Avoid At Startup<td>Toggles Bash to avoid the Installers tab on startup, thus avoiding unnecessary data scanning. Unless you're spending a lot of time in the Installers tab, you should enable this.

        <tr><td colspan="2" id="bainAutoAnneal">Auto-Anneal<td>Toggles the auto-anneal process on/off. Preferred setting: enabled.
        <tr><td colspan="2" id="bainAutoAnnealInstallWizards">Auto-Anneal/Install Wizards<td>Toggles whether or not to automatically install/anneal a package when finished with its wizard.
        <tr><td colspan="2" id="bainAutoRefreshProjects">Auto-Refresh Projects<td>Toggles the auto-refreshing of projects on/off. Preferred setting: enabled.

<h2 id="mods">Mods Tab</h2>
<h3 id="mods-exclusion">Exclusion Groups</h3>
<p>Exclusion groups can be used to help flag plugins that are incompatible. Incompatible plugins can be placed into exclusion groups, and when more than one plugin in a group is present, the plugins will be highlighted in orange.
<p>An exclusion group may be defined or added to by renaming a plugin, putting the exclusion group name first, then a comma, then the plugin's original name. Eg. <code>Group, My plugin.esp</code>. If plugins share the same exclusion group name, they will be members of the same exclusion group.
<p><b>Note:</b> The usage of exclusion groups is not recommended. Renaming plugins will cause them to become unrecognised by features such as BAIN or utilities such as BOSS that expect plugins to have the names they are distributed with. Renaming plugins will also break any plugins that are dependent on them.

<p>The plugin details panel contains the following:
<table>
    <thead><tr><th>Item<th>Description
    <tbody>
        <tr><td>File Name<td>The filename of the selected plugin. Note that changing this does not change the filename in the Masters Lists of any dependent plugins.
        <tr><td>Modification Time<td>For Oblivion, this affects the load order of the selected plugin. For Skyrim, it has no effect, except that if it is changed for a plugin obtained from Steam Workshop, it will cause the plugin to be redownloaded as Steam Workshop uses modification time to detect file versions.
        <tr><td>Author<td>Who made the selected plugin.
        <tr><td>Description<td>Commonly used for a short description of what the selected plugin does, plus the version number and any Bash Tags the author sets.
        <tr><td>Masters List<td>The Masters list show the plugins (.esm or .esp) that the currently selected plugin depends on, the load order
        (Mod Index) of that master in the plugin file, and the current load order of the master plugin if present and active.<br /><br />
        Plugins' entries in the Masters List may be renamed to reflect name changes of the plugins themselves. To rename a master, first allow editing from the
        masters list column context menu and then either left-click the plugin entry and edit it in the column display, or right-click the
        plugin and select <q>Change To...</q> then select the replacement plugin. <b>Do not</b> use this to change a plugin's masters to
        unrelated plugins, as this will cause file corruption.<br />
        If editing is allowed, items that are renamed inside Bash internal dictionaries appear <b>bolded</b> - on clicking on the masterlist they
        take their renamed values and the <i>Save</i> and <i>Cancel</i> buttons are enabled. You may click on Save to save the new master list,
        or on Cancel to revert displaying the non renamed masters.<br />
        Disallowing edits will revert the list to the original and disable Save and Cancel buttons (if no other fields are edited).<br />
        <tr><td>MI<td>Master Index of the mod. This means the actual number of the masters in succession starting with 00 Skyrim.esm, or 00 Oblivion.esm.<br />
        <tr><td>Current LO<td>Current load order in relation to the load order of the Active Plugins. Active Plugins should correspond with plugins.txt.
        <tr><td>Bash Tags<td>This field lists any Bash Tags that are assigned to the selected plugin. Right-clicking will display a list of Bash Tags and allow you to add or remove tags by checking or unchecking them.
</table>

<h3 id="mod-masters-symbols">Color scheme for Plugin Masters (MI &amp; Current LO)</h3>
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr><th>Checkbox Colour<th>Meaning
    <tbody>
        <tr><td><img src="../bash/images/checkbox_blue_on.png" alt="Blue"/><td>Good. Matches the Master Index of the the Current load order.
        <tr><td><img src="../bash/images/checkbox_green_on.png" alt="Green"/><td>Good, but the Master Index is not in sync with the Current load order.
        <tr><td><img src="../bash/images/checkbox_orange_on.png" alt="Orange"/><td>Master Index differs from the Current load order. Masters of this plugin still exist in the Data folder but plugins are out of order compared to the order of its masters when the mod was saved.<br />
        <br />If a plugin has two masters that are siblings (one doesn't have the other as a master, so they can load in either order) and they are overriding the same record from an earlier master (e.g. both are overriding a record from the main game master file), then loading them in a different order will result in a different version of the overridden record being the “winner”. But the plugin might depend on the winner being the one indicated by the order in which it references the masters. The plugin should be examined in xEdit (meaning any version) to see if it is best to alter the load order or if Sort Masters should be used to correct the issue.
        <tr><td><img src="../bash/images/checkbox_red_on.png" alt="Red"/><td>A Master is missing. If unintended then you should check to make sure that you have not inadvertently renamed or removed the plugin.
</table>

<h3 id="mods-csv">CSV Files</h3>
<p>Wrye Bash uses CSV files for many of its plugin data related features. CSV files are a very widely supported type of spreadsheet file, and once exported may be edited in programs like Microsoft Excel, LibreOffice Calc or even in text editors such as Notepad or Notepad++.
<p>CSV files are used by the Import/Export... commands as this allows much easier editing of record data in large batches or in systematic manners than in the Construction Set. The data may be exported, edited in the CSV, then imported again. The following notes apply to CSV files.
<ul>
    <li>Wrye Bash will ignore any lines in a CSV file for which the second column does not begin with <code>0x</code>, so such lines can be used for comments.
    <li>For Sigil Stones and Spell Stats CSV exports, additional effects can be added to a stone/spell by appending effects to the end of a line, leaving one blank column between each effect. If any of the Script Effect columns are set to <q>None</q> then all the script effects for that effect will be ignored.
    <li>For the values of object stats such as price or weight or damage, etc., formulae may be used to work out the numerical values, but the file should contain the resulting numbers, not the formulae used.
    <li>The faction lists for actors do not need to be complete - only the actor/faction pairs added or changed need to be listed. A rank of -1 in a faction will remove an actor from that faction.
    <li>Relation lists do not need to be complete for each faction - only the added/changed main/other pairs need to be listed.
</ul>
<p>CSV files can also be used when building the Bashed Patch, for a number of options. The Bashed Patch builder will automatically detect the presence of any CSV files in the <code>Data\Bash Patches</code> folder and have the correct filename ending. These filename endings are:
<table>
    <thead><tr><th>Import Type<th>Required Filename Ending

        <tr><td>Edit Lists...<td>Allows the deletion and renaming of load lists.
        <tr><td>[Load List]<td>[Load List] is the name of a load list, which are listed below the separator in the Load submenu. Clicking a load list will apply it, deactivating any plugins that are not listed as active in it.
        <tr><td colspan="2">Sort By<td>This submenu allows you to choose by which column the plugin list is sorted. This is equivalent to clicking on a column header. You can also choose to sort by <q>Type</q>, which will place .esms before .esps regardless of the sorting criteria, or by <q>Selection</q>, which places selected plugins before unselected plugins regardless of criteria.
        <tr><td colspan="2">Oblivion.esm<td><i>Oblivion only.</i> This submenu relates to <a href="#tools-swapping">Oblivion.esm Swapping</a>.
        <tr><td colspan="2">Columns<td>This submenu allows you to choose which columns are visible in the mod list.

        <tr><td>New Mod...<td>Creates an empty plugin.
        <tr><td>Open...<td>Opens the Data folder in Windows Explorer.
        <tr><td>Unhide...<td>Opens a dialogue window allowing you to select which hidden plugins to unhide.
        <tr><td colspan="2" id="modsListMods">List Mods<td>This outputs a BBCode-formatted load order, including version information, activation status and major load order errors. It can be useful for debugging a broken load order. If the 'c' keyboard key is pressed when this command is selected, the CRCs of plugins will also be displayed in the output.
        <tr><td colspan="2">List Bash Tags<td>This outputs a BBCode-formatted list of all the Bash Tags applied to the plugins in your load order, and where/how the Bash Tags were specified. It can be useful for debugging a broken load order.
        <tr><td colspan="2" id="modsAutoGhost">Auto-Ghost<td>The game engine has a bug where it reads all the plugins in the Data folder, and this can affect performance when the number of plugins is around 300+. Auto-Ghosting adds a <q>.ghost</q> extension to all inactive plugins automatically to prevent the game engine reading them, and so helping to avoid the performance drop. When a ghosted plugin is activated, the <q>.ghost</q> extension is removed, allowing it to function as normal. Note that other utilities will not recognise ghosted plugins, so there are options available for individual plugins to control which get ghosted.
        <tr><td colspan="2">Lock Load Order<td><i>Oblivion only.</i> This prevents other utilities from altering plugin modification times. More accurately, it detects changes to modification times when Wrye Bash is focused (ie. on top of all other program windows) and reverses those changes.
        <tr><td colspan="2">Debug Mode<td>Activates debug output. Only a few commands will display any debug output, but it may be useful for troubleshooting.
        <tr><td colspan="2">TES4Edit Expert<td>If checked, this option runs TES4Edit with the <code>-IKnowWhatImDoing</code> argument, activating more advanced functionality, whenever TES4Edit is run from its launcher in the status bar.
        <tr><td colspan="2" id="modsRemoveDummyMasters">Remove Dummy Masters...<td>Removes all dummy master files created using <a href="#modsCreateDummyMasters">Create Dummy Masters...</a> on a plugin.
        <tr><td colspan="2">Check mods against BOSS's dirty mod list<td>BOSS's masterlist contains information on dirty plugins that can be used by Wrye Bash to highlight these plugins in the mod list. Checking this setting tells Wrye Bash to use this information if BOSS is installed.

                </ul>
                <p>Note that if either of the new or old sides of a row are empty, the row will be skipped. Also, the new object does not have to be of the same type as the old object, but they should be compatible.

            </ol>

This can be done using TES4Edit's <q>Clean Masters</q> command or TES4Gecko's <q>Edit Master List</q> command. The former only removes totally unused masters while the latter can remove used masters with the appropriate cleanup, and is not an automated procedure.
            <p><b>Note:</b> You can also use TES4Edit to change the Form IDs using its <q>Batch Change Referencing Records</q> command together with the CSV file created. TES4Edit will also change the definition of a Form ID, rather than just any references to it, unlike Wrye Bash.

            Esm files cannot be edited in the Construction Set as esp files, so this command is disabled for them. NB: the file extension won't change

            savegames will get confused, possibly causing bugs and corruption. To toggle the masters back use the same command on the plugin which

<h2 id="patch">Advanced Bashed Patch</h2>
<p>You can have multiple Bashed Patches, though one is generally enough per <a href="#saves-profiles">save profile</a> or character. The only requirement for Wrye Bash recognising a plugin as a Bashed Patch is that its <q>Author</q> field is set to <q>BASHED PATCH</q>, so you can name a Bashed Patch whatever you want.
<h3 id="patch-view">Viewing &amp; Editing The Bashed Patch</h3>
<p>As the Bashed Patch commonly has .esp files as masters, viewing and editing it can be more complicated than for the average plugin. If you wish to view its contents, it is easiest to use <a href="http://oblivion.nexusmods.com/mods/11536">TES4Edit</a>, which can also be used to edit most types of data in plugins. To edit it using the Construction Set or Creation Kit (required when editing scripts), you'll need to first use the <a href="#modsEsmifyMasters">Esmify Masters</a> command on it. Be sure to use <q>Espify Masters</q> before attempting to play the game.

<h3 id="patch-tags">Bash Tags</h3>
<p>Wrye Bash uses a tagging system to determine what mods can and should have which records available for importing into the Bashed Patch. These Bash Tags are specified by mod authors in the header descriptions of their plugins, or are applied using data from three sources:
<ul>
    <li>BOSS's masterlist and userlist files. If BOSS is installed, then Wrye Bash will apply its Bash Tag suggestions. You do not need to use BOSS to benefit from this, it just needs to be installed. REPLACE lines in the userlist will replace Bash Tags suggested in the masterlist, but will not affect Bash Tags specified in plugin description fields.
    <li>The <code>Bash Patches\Leveled Lists.csv</code> file. This file contains a small list that is useful if BOSS is not installed.
    <li>The <code>Bash Patches\taglist.txt</code> file. This is a stripped-down version of the BOSS masterlist as it was when the version of Wrye Bash installed was released.
</ul>
<p>Bash Tags may also be set manually, by right-clicking a plugin's Bash Tags field in the Mods Tab sidebar and checking or unchecking tags in the list displayed. If you wish to revert to automatic tagging, choose <q>Automatic</q> in the right-click list. If you are a mod author, you may wish to use <q>Copy to Description</q> for your mod's plugins before releasing it to ensure that users have the tags applied automatically.
<p><b>Note:</b> A Bash Tag should only be applied when it is <b>important</b> that the plugin's change to whatever the Tag relates to is preserved. If a change your plugin makes is not important to the functioning of your mod, do not add a Bash Tag for it. Doing otherwise negates the purpose of the Bash Tag system.

<h3 id="#patch-filter">Merge Filtering</h3>
<p>Merge filtering is an advanced option that allows records in a merged mod to be selectively filtered according to the current load order. For example, a patch mod could be created to rebalance weapons from several different weapon-adding mods. This feature would allow the patch to be used even if you didn't use all the mods, and the Bashed Patch would just apply the bits for the mods you do use. This saves the need for a separate patch plugin for each mod.
<p>Merge filtering has requisite conditions that must be fulfilled for a plugin to take advantage of it, and some limitations. These conditions and limitations are:
<ul>
    <li>The plugin must be mergeable and tagged with <code>Filter</code>.
    <li>The plugin must not be active at the time the patch is built. Note that if the user doesn't have all the plugin's masters installed, it will have to remain deactivated at all times.
    <li>Filtering is done according to the currently active plugins: it is therefore very important that all the desired plugins are active when the Bashed Patch is built.
    <li>Filtering is mostly limited to the top level, ie. if the plugin a record is from is missing, the record will be skipped. However, if a record references another record, and the latter's plugin is missing, the former will not be skipped, and the Bashed Patch will end up dependent on the latter's plugin being installed.
    <li>There are a few exceptions to the above limitation: entries in leveled lists will be filtered, as will spells, factions and items referenced in Creature and NPC records.
</ul>


<h3 id="#patch-iim">Item Interchange Mode</h3>
<p>Item Interchange Mode is a 'hack' (a horribly inelegant and inconsistent implementation of a feature that nonetheless works) to support Vacuity's Item Interchange mod.
<p>Activation of the mode for a plugin relies on the following conditions:
<ul>
    <li>The plugin is tagged with <code>IIM</code>.
    <li>The plugin is being merged into the Bashed Patch.
    <li>The plugin is tagged with <code>Filter</code>.
</ul>
<p>Item Interchange Mode has the following effects:
<ul>
    <li>Prevents the records in the plugin from being merged into the Bashed Patch, apart from leveled list records, which are merged in.
    <li>Prevents all the patch components except from the Leveled Lists and Import Inventory from even looking at the plugin.
    <li>Causes Import Inventory to ignore all changes in the plugin except inventory changes.
</ul>

        <tr><td>As Intended: Boars<td>Adds the Bethesda Boar Resistances spells to all boars (found by the UOP team, based off of a mod made by Tejon).
        <tr><td>As Intended: Imps<td>Adds the Bethesda Imp Resistances spells to imps (found by the UOP team, based off of a mod made by Tejon). May choose to apply to all imps, only full size imps, or only implings.
        <tr><td>Irresponsible Creatures<td>Sets responsibility to 0 for all/specified creatures - so they can't report you for crimes.
        <tr><td>Mayu's Animation Overhaul Skeleton Tweaker<td>Sets NPC skeletons paths to match that required for MAO to work. <b>Requires</b> Mayu's Animation Overhaul or it will almost certainly cause CTDs.
        <tr><td>No Bloody Creatures<td>Nulls the blood records of all creatures; acts like 'Mart's Monster Mod - No Blood.esp' except it is universal and doesn't work with MMM (MMM uses a different system - it won't cause any harm if used with MMM, it will just have pretty much no effect).
        <tr><td>Quiet Feet<td>Removes all/some 'foot' sounds from creatures; on some computers can have a significant performance boost.
        <tr><td>Real Walk for female NPCs<td>Changes all female NPCs to use Mur Zuk's Real Walk. <b>Requires</b> Mur Zuk's Real Walk animation file.
        <tr><td>Redguard FGTS Nuller<td>Sets Redguard NPC FGTS subrecords to null; for use with Better Redguards.
        <tr><td>Sexy Walk for female NPCs<td>Changes all female NPCs to use Mur Zuk's Sexy Walk. <b>Requires</b> Mur Zuk's Sexy Walk animation file.
        <tr><td>VadersApp's Oblivion Real Bodies Skeleton Tweaker<td>Changes all (modded and vanilla) NPCs to use diverse skeletons for different look. Not compatible with MAO. <b>Requires</b> VadersApp's Oblivion Real Bodies.
        <tr><td>Vanilla Beast Skeleton Tweaker<td>Sets any NPCs using the vanilla non-beast skeleton path (skeleton.nif) to use the beast skeleton patch (skeletonbeast.nif). This avoids bugs when a mod changes the race of an NPC to a beast race without setting the skeleton path to the beast path, in which case the tail will appear to extend forever and weird stuff like that.

        <tr><td>Armor Shows Rings<td>Modifies playable armor to show rings.
        <tr><td>Bow Reach Fix<td>Some of the bows in Oblivion (and a few in user mods) have a reach of zero. Due to a bug in the Oblivion engine, if these bows are equipped by an NPC, the game will crash. This patch changes bows with zero reach to have reach of 1.

        <tr><td>Disable Wind<td>Sets wind speed for all weathers to 0; this means that bushes and trees don't move in the wind since there isn't any. May help on machines with low end graphic cards.
        <tr><td>Faction Crime Gold Multplier Fix<td>Fix factions with unset crimeGoldMultiplier to have a crimeGoldMultiplier of 1.0.
        <tr><td>Harvest Chance<td>Sets the harvest chance of all flora to the desired chance.
        <tr><td>Magic: Script Effect Silencer<td>Script Effects will be silenced and have no graphics.
        <tr><td>No Light Fade Value Fix<td>Sets the fade values on all lights to a default of 1.0 if not already set.
        <tr><td>No Light Flicker<td>Turns off flickering effects for lights. May help on machines with low end graphic cards.
        <tr><td>Number of uses for pre-enchanted weapons and Staffs/Staves<td>The charge amount and cast cost will be edited so that all enchanted weapons and staffs have the amount of uses specified. Cost will be rounded up to 1 (unless set to unlimited) so number of uses may not exactly match for all weapons.
        <tr><td>Nvidia Fog Fix<td>Ensures that cells have at least one non-zero fog value. For avoiding the Nvidia fog-related black screen. This feature is based on <a href="http://planetelderscrolls.gamespy.com/View.php?view=oblivionmods.detail&amp;id=2859">Quarn's Nvidia Black Screen Fix</a>.
        <tr><td>Reweigh: Arrows<td>Reweighs arrows to a maximum weight.
        <tr><td>Reweigh: Ingredients<td>Reweighs ingredients to a maximum weight.
        <tr><td>Reweigh: Potions (Maximum)<td>Reweighs potions to a maximum weight. This does not affect potions with script effects or with current weight >= 1.0. Thus it should not affect alcoholic beverages or scripted "potions" like HTS water skins. Note that this is similar to, but not the same as, the Reweigh Potions command for savegames, which reweighs user created potions rather than mod created potions.
        <tr><td>Reweigh: Potions (Minimum)<td>Reweighs potions to a minimum weight.
        <tr><td>Reweigh: Staffs/Staves<td>Reweighs staves to a maximum weight.
        <tr><td>Right Hand Rings<td>Makes rings behave more consistently by making all rings prefer to be on the right hand. With this tweak activated, rings will only equip to the left hand if the right hand has a ring, but the left hand does not. You can use this to make one ring permanently equipped - just equip it to the left hand and it will stay on until you specifically unequip it.
        <tr><td>Set Sound Attenuation Levels<td>The sound attenuation levels will be set to tweak%*current level, thereby increasing (or decreasing) the sound volume (lower attenuation = higher volume).
        <tr><td>Set Sound Attenuation Levels: Nirnroots Only<td>The sound attenuation levels will be set to tweak%*current level, thereby increasing (or decreasing) the sound volume (lower attenuation = higher volume). This one only affects Nirnroots.
        <tr><td>Skyrim-style Weapons<td>Sets all one handed weapons as blades, two handed weapons as blunt.
        <tr><td>Uniform Groundcover<td>Eliminates the random variation in groundcover (grass, vines, shrubs, etc). Tall groundcover will still be taller than short groundcover, but there will be less variation in size. May help on lower end machines.

<h3 id="patch-lists">Leveled Lists</h3>
<p>The leveled list patcher is slightly odd in comparison to the others: it's effectively an <q>Import...</q> patcher, but its options are decided automatically by default.
<p>First, a bit of background. When different plugins alter the same leveled list, only the last loaded plugin's changes get applied. This tends not to be what is wanted. The leveled list patcher circumvents the issue by instead merging all the changes made to leveled lists and having this merged set of changes applied.
<p>The leveled list merging is dictated by related Bash Tags, and functions as follows.
<ul>
    <li>The load order of plugins is still important to the result of the leveled list patcher. It decides what plugins' effects override others.
    <li>Untagged plugins can only add new entries to leveled lists. If such a plugin adds an entry that already exists, it will be ignored. Furthermore, even if another plugin has already marked that entry as removed, it will not be re-added.
    <li><code>Delev</code> tagged plugins can remove entries from leveled lists. Any items present in such a plugin's masters but not in the plugin itself will be removed.
    <li><code>Relev</code> tagged plugins can relevel an existing entry (ie. change its levels and/or counts in the list), and can also override previous deletions of entries from leveled lists. However, it does not prevent a later-loading <code>Delev</code> tagged plugin from then removing an entry again.
    <li><code>Delev</code> and <code>Relev</code> tagged mods simply combines the effects of the <code>Delev</code> and <code>Relev</code> Bash Tags.
    <li>In addition to the above, the leveled list patcher removes any empty sublists from leveled lists, as these would otherwise cause the leveled list to select nothing if such a sublist was picked in-game.
</ul>
<p>It's best to simply ensure that your plugins have the correct tags and leave this section on automatic. To add plugins to or remove plugins from the list, uncheck the <q>Automatic</q> checkbox, and use the <q>Add</q> or <q>Remove</q> buttons. The latter will remove the currently selected plugin.
<p>To manually override the Delev/Relev Bash Tags for a plugin, right-click it in the section list and check or uncheck the relevant options as desired. To return to the automatic setting, select the <q>Auto</q> option in the right-click menu.


<h2 id="saves">Saves Tab</h2>
<figure>
<img src="../bash/images/readme/saves.png" alt="Saves Tab"/>
<figcaption>Wrye Bash's Saves tab.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3 id="saves-overview">Overview</h3>
<p>The Saves tab allows you to manage many aspects related to your game's saves. Save files are found in the <code>My Games\[Game]\Saves</code> directory and have the file extension <code>.ess</code>. When you quicksave or autosave, the game backs up the previous quick/autosave by replacing the file extension with <code>.bak</code>. This backup may be restored by restoring its original file extension.
<p>If you have Pluggy and/or the game's Script Extender installed, each of your save files will have a corresponding <q>cosave</q> containing the Pluggy/OBSE/SKSE-specific data. These cosaves have file extensions <code>.pluggy</code>, <code>.obse</code>, <code>.skse</code> for Pluggy, OBSE and SKSE respectively.
<p>The Saves tab is divided into two sections: the main panel lists your save files and displays some of their details in its columns. The Save Details panel on the right displays some more information relating to the currently selected save file. It comprises of the following sections:
<table>
    <thead><tr><th>Section<th>Description
    <tbody>
        <tr><td>File Name<td>This is the filename of the save. Changing it here will rename the save file.
        <tr><td>Player Info<td>These three lines give the player character's name, their level, days have passed in-game, hours played and current location.
        <tr><td>O/P Flags<td> These two flags appear to the right of the player info, and indicate the presence of cosave files: O is for OBSE cosaves, and P is for Pluggy cosaves.
        <tr><td>Screenshot<td>The screenshot embedded in the save file, taken at the moment of saving.
        <tr><td>Masters List<td>The Masters list show the plugins (.esm or .esp) that the currently selected save file depends on, the load order
        (Mod Index) of that master in the save file, and the current load order of the master plugin if present and active.<br /><br />
        Masters in the list can be renamed if the corresponding plugin has been renamed. To rename a master, first allow editing from the
        masters list column context menu and then either left-click it and edit it in the column display, or right-click it and select <q>Change To...</q> to select the desired
        replacement plugin from the Data directory. Note that you should only do this if the new name is a new version of the same mod.
        Replacing a mod with an unrelated mod will cause file corruption.<br />
        If editing is allowed, items that are renamed inside Bash internal dictionaries appear <b>bolded</b> - on clicking on the masterlist they
        take their renamed values and the <i>Save</i> and <i>Cancel</i> buttons are enabled. You may click on Save to save the new master list,
        or on Cancel to revert displaying the non renamed masters.<br />
        Disallowing edits will revert the list to the original and disable Save and Cancel buttons (if no other fields are edited).<br />
            <ul>
                <li>Note that currently renaming the master in the OBSE/SKSE cosave is NOT supported (except for very old OBSE versions). If the
        save has a cosave this will most probably corrupt the cosave.
                See <a href="https://github.com/wrye-bash/wrye-bash/issues/236">the related issue</a> (help wanted).
            </ul>
        Masters can also be disabled (again if editing is allowed) if they have been removed and are preventing your save from loading, as may sometimes happen,
        by right-clicking them and selecting <q>Disable</q>. Note that logical errors may still occur that prevent the removal of
        the plugin dependency, but this will let the game <i>try</i> to remove the dependency.<br />
        <tr><td>MI<td>Master Index of the save game. This means the actual number of the masters in succession starting with 00 Skyrim.esm, or 00 Oblivion.esm.<br />
        <tr><td>Current LO<td>Current load order in relation to the load order of the Active Plugins. Active Plugins should correspond with plugins.txt.
        <tr><td>Notes<td>This section can be used to keep notes on the save file.
</table>

        <tr><td><img src="../bash/images/checkbox_orange_on.png" alt="Orange"/><td>Some plugins have changed order. the game and the Construction Set/Creation Kit will adjust for this when loaded. However, if some of the plugins that you depend made conflicting changes to the same item, a different plugin may now dominate because of the reordering.
        <tr><td><img src="../bash/images/checkbox_red_on.png" alt="Red"/><td>A master is missing. You should check to make sure that you have not inadvertently renamed or removed the plugin.

</table>

<h3 id="saves-profiles">Save Profiles</h3>
<p>Save profiles are like player accounts, in that they consist of a load order plus a set of save files. They can be used to allow safe and easy switching between different characters than may use different combinations of mods, or between different stages of the same character's life (where different mods have been used in each stage). They can also associate different versions of Oblivion.esm with different save profiles, using <a href="#tools-swapping">Oblivion.esm Swapping</a>.
<p>To create or modify save profiles, use the <a href="#savesEditProfiles">Edit Profiles...</a> command in the <q>Profile</q> submenu of the column header context menu. You can create a new save profile using <q>Add</q>, delete the selected existing save profile using <q>Remove</q> and rename the selected save profile using <q>Rename</q>. The central text field can be used to store notes on the selected save profile.
<p>To select a save profile, select it from the list visible in the <q>Profile</q> submenu of the column header context menu.
<p>To assign save files to a save profile, use the <a href="#savesMoveTo">Move To</a> or <a href="#savesCopyTo">Copy To</a> submenus in the save file context menu. This will also assign any related cosave files.


<h3 id="saves-face">Face Import</h3>
<figure>
<img src="../bash/images/readme/wryebash_03.png" alt="Face Import from Esp"/>
<figcaption>Wrye Bash's Face Import dialog.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Faces may be imported from saves to saves or plugins, or from plugins to saves. This allows you to preserve a character's appearance should you wish to restart a character, to roleplay as a particular character, or to turn your character into an NPC that may be encountered during playing, among other uses.
<p>To import a face to a save:
<ol>
    <li>Select the <a href="#savesImportFace">Import Face...</a> command in a save file's context menu.
    <li>Choose the source save or plugin in the file dialogue that is displayed.
    <li>Choose the actor whose face you want to import. Click on a face in the list to display its details. If an image is associated with the face, it will be displayed.
    <ul>
        <li>If you chose a source plugin, the plugin's NPCs will be listed.
        <li>If you chose a source save, the player character will be at the top of the list, possibly followed by some clones of the player that the game uses for various purposes and some other NPCs.
    </ul>
    <li>Use the checkboxes to select additional characteristics to import.
    <ul>
        <li><b>The Race Import is incomplete.</b> It will change the physical appearance and identification of the character, but not the racial powers.
        <li><b>Use the Stats Import with care.</b> In-game stats are a combination of base stats, magical modifiers and scripted modifications. This command only affects the base stats. As such, the in-game effect may be negative or bizarrely high. In addition, such alteration of stats often confuses releveling mods, and such a mod may require temporary removal so that stats are imported to a save which does not have it active. Such mods can be reinstalled once the stats have been imported.
    </ul>
    <li>Click the <q>Import</q> button to finish.
</ol>
<p>To import a face to a plugin:
<ol>
    <li>Create a new plugin using the <a href="#modsNewMod">New Mod</a> command from the <q>File</q> menu of the plugin context menu in the Mods tab.
    <li>Right-click the new plugin and select <a href="#modsImportFace">Import Face...</a>.
    <li>Choose the source save in the file dialogue that is displayed.
</ol>
<p>Some notes on the usage of Face Import:
<ul>
    <li>Face Import does not check for unique Editor IDs. The Construction Set will inform you of any duplicates and auto-rename them, though you will probably want to rename them manually as DUPLICATE0000 is not very informative.
    <li>If you want to associate an image with a face, save the image to <code>Data\Docs\Images\[EditorID].jpg</code>, where [EditorID] is the Editor ID of the face. The size of the image box is 250x210 pixels. Wrye Bash will scale down any image supplied to fit the box.
    <li>To tweak the stats of an existing character, try importing them to a plugin, editing them there and then importing the character back into your save file.
    <li>Normally when importing a face to a plugin, only eyes and hair from Oblivion.esm or the destination plugin will be imported. However, the following steps can be used to import eyes and hairs that come from other mods.
    <ul>
        <li>Convert the source cosmetic ESP to an ESM, using the <a href="#modsCopyToEsm">Copy to Esm</a> command in the plugin context menu in the Mods tab.
        <li>Open the destination plugin in the Construction Set, also loading the converted source cosmetic ESM.
        <li>Save the plugin in the Construction Set.
        <li>In Wrye Bash's Mods tab, select the converted source cosmetic ESM in the destination plugin's Masters List and use the <q>Change To...</q> command to select the source cosmetic ESP.
        <li>Now import the face as normal. The eyes/hair should also be imported.
    </ul>
</ul>

If one savegame is selected, then this will compare the currently active plugins to the masters of the selected savegame. The comparison details masters that have been removed and added in the newer save since the older save, or removed and added in the load order since the selected save.
        <tr><td colspan="2" id="savesStatistics">Statistics<td><i>Oblivion only.</i> This produces a set of various technical statistics for the selected savegame. The following information is produced:
            <ul>
                <li>Array sizes. These arrays are for each of the major sections in the save file.
                <li>Created items. These are items created in-game, through scripting or some sort of crafting skill (eg. alchemy, spellmaking).
                <li>Form IDs. This is a breakdown of the Form ID table in the savegame, sorted by source plugin. The Form ID table maps savegame reference numbers to the Form ID of the referenced record. If a reference is made to a record from a mod that is no longer loaded, the Form ID is replaced with a 0.
                <li>Record details. This gives a breakdown of the different types of records stored in the save file. The type is given as a number and as text (eg. <code>48 Cell</code>), and then the number of records referenced from each plugin is given below.
                <li>New ObjectRef Bases. These are objects that belong to the savegame, for example arrows dropped on the ground in-game. They generally are created and destroyed by the game as required, though bad scripting techniques can cause some of them to stick around. The "Base" of an objectRef is the baseid of the object (e.g., the formid of a steel arrow from Oblivion.esm). The objectRef refers to these indirectly through an "iref". Usually this will map back to a formid, but if the original mod has been removed from the load order, then the formid is set to zero. If this has happened, then a count of such "Null Bases" will be shown. After the "Null Base" count (if present) is a list of New ObjectRef Bases where the count is over 100 (e.g., if there are over 100 new arrows lying around). Show is the count, the iref and the base formid. Formid beginning with FF is reference to an object defined by the savegame. Otherwise, the formid will map back to a mod. The first two digits are the modindex, and can be matched to a mod through the "MI" column in the list of savegame masters.
            </ul>
        <tr><td colspan="2">.obse Statistics<td><i>Oblivion only.</i> This is similar to <a href="#savesStatistics">Statistics</a> above, but reports statistics for the .pluggy and/or .obse cosave files associated with the selected save.

        <tr><td colspan="2" id="savesReweighPotions">Reweigh Potions...<td><i>Oblivion only.</i> Potions created in-game are given a weight that is somewhat arbitrarily selected and potentially high. This command may be used to set all created potions to have a specific weight. Potions created after the use of this command with new names, new effects or new durations will not be affected.
        <tr><td colspan="2" id="savesUpdateNPCLevels">Update NPC Levels...<td><i>Oblivion only.</i> Updates the level information for NPCs stored in the selected savegame to reflect the active load order's NPC level settings. This is required because although NPC levels are set via plugins, once an NPC is encountered its level is stored in the save file, which overrides the plugin levels.
        <tr><td colspan="2">Export Screenshot...<td>Allows you to save the image used as the save file's screenshot as a JPEG.
        <tr><td colspan="2" id="savesRemoveBloat">Remove Bloat...<td><i>Oblivion only.</i> <b>This is an experimental command. It is recommended that saves are backed up before using it on them.</b> It attempts to determine how much bloating there is in the selected save file and then optionally remove it. If the command reports a large number of created objects, there could be a problem with one of your mods, and such mods should be removed or updated. There are two common types of bloat:
            <ul>
                <li>Excess created objects can occur through the use of scripting by a mod to duplicate existing objects in-game and a failure by the mod to clean up the duplicates after their use.
                <li>Null references are caused when objects from a mod that is removed are present in the game world. These objects then get replaced with null references when the game is next saved with the mod missing.
            </ul>
        <tr><td colspan="2" id="savesRepairAbomb">Repair Abomb<td><i>Oblivion only.</i> <q>Abomb Animation Slowing</q> is a slowing of animations that typically occurs around 225 hours into the game, though it may occur earlier or later. This is an engine bug, and this command avoids its effects by resetting a related counter (TesClass Abomb counter is reset to 0x41000000).
        <tr><td colspan="2">Repair Hair<td><i>Oblivion only.</i> Oblivion has a bug that will cause a crash if your PC's hair comes from a mod that has been removed and you then run showRaceMenu. This command resets your hair to the default for that race and gender, so you can then use showRaceMenu to select a new hair again if you wish.

<figcaption style="padding-top:95px;">The Hide option in the right-click menu for launchers.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You can hide specific launcher icons, preventing them from being displayed, by right-clicking them and selecting <q>Hide...</q> or by inserting a semicolon before their path in the <q>bash.ini</q>.
<ul><li>For example, <code>sPhotoshopPath=;C:\Program Files\Adobe\Photoshop 7.0\Photoshop.exe</code>.</ul>
<p>You can hide some of the toggle buttons using the <code>bShowTes4...</code> options in the <code>Tool Options</code> in the <q>bash.ini</q>.
<p>You can unhide launchers hidden through the right-click option using the Settings menu. See the <a href="#tools-settings">Settings Menu</a> for more information.


<h3 id="launchers-custom">Custom Launchers</h3>
<p>Custom launcher buttons may be added by putting a shortcut to the application you wish to have a launcher for in the <code>Mopy\Apps</code> directory. Wrye Bash will then use the following information from the shortcut:
<ul>
    <li>Icon
    <li>Working directory
    <li>Command line arguments
    <li>Comments
</ul>
<p>If you want to have a custom icon for a launcher, place a PNG image with the same name as the shortcut, appending the icon size, in the same folder. For example:
<ul>
    <li>Notepadpp.lnk
    <li>Notepadpp24.png
</ul>
<p><b>Note:</b> 24x24 icons taken from shortcuts do not work well, so if you are using this size, be sure to include a custom icon. Icon size displayed can be adjusted in the <q>bash.ini</q> or the <a href="#tools-settings">Settings</a> menu.

<figcaption>Wrye Bash's PM Archive tab.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="pm-overview">Overview</h3>
<p>The PM Archive tab can be used to archive, view and search Private Messages from the official Bethesda Softworks forums. Due to forum updates, messages archived since the 13th of March 2010 cannot be imported into Wrye Bash. As such, the tab is only available for legacy support of those with messages archived before then.
<p><b>Warning:</b> This feature is both experimental and outdated. Keep a separate backup of any archives you import into Wrye Bash.
<p>To import PM archives into Wrye Bash, follow the instructions below:
<ol>
    <li>Archive your PMs using the forum option, then download the HTML archive that is emailed as an attachment to you.
    <li>Rename the archive file so that the filename begins with the date the archive was created, in the format YY.MM.DD. Eg. <code>07.11.06 archive.html</code>. It doesn't matter what the name is after the date.
    <li>In Wrye Bash's PM Archives tab, right-click the box at the top and select <q>Import Archives...</q> then select the archive files you wish to import.
</ol>
<p>PMs may be searched using the bar at the bottom of the window, by entering in the search text then clicking the <q>Search</q> button or hitting return on your keyboard. Messages may be sorted by any of the columns by clicking a column header. Selecting multiple messages will display them all at once in the order they are listed.

<h3 id="people-overview">Overview</h3>
<p>The People tab functions as a simple database that can be used to keep notes on various people (eg. why you blocked a forum user, or what a good mod someone made).
<p>People are listed in the column on the left, and the large text box on the right can be used for writing notes on the selected person. Notes are saved automatically as you type them, but otherwise the text box behaves as a simple text editor such as Notepad.
<p>The Karma column displays the karma level you have set for them. Karma is a simple way of rating your disposition towards a person. The Header column displays the first 75 characters of text in a person's notes. Clicking a column header will sort by that column.

</figure>
<p>The Doc Browser allows you to quickly and easily scan through your mods' documentation. The supported document types are: text files, HTML files and MHT files (HTML archives). To display the Doc Browser, double click any plugin in the main list of the Mods tab.
<p>When you double-click a plugin, Wrye Bash will open the Doc Browser and attempt to determine which document to associate with it. If it can determine one, it will display it. Otherwise, a blank page will be displayed. To associate a document with a plugin, use the <q>Set Doc...</q> button in the Doc Browser. To disassociate a document with a plugin, use the <q>Forget Doc...</q> button in the Doc Browser.
<p>You can also rename an associated document using the <q>Rename Doc...</q> button to select a new name and/or location. The document will be renamed and/or moved to this location.
<p>You can edit a document by clicking the <q>Edit Doc...</q> button. The document can then be edited in the viewing window. To finish editing, click the <q>Edit Doc...</q> button again. Changes are automatically saved when you select a new plugin, close the Doc Browser or finish editing.
<p>A document can be opened in its default external editor by clicking the <q>Open Doc...</q> button.
<p>A new document can be created for a plugin by clicking the <q>Set Doc...</q> button and choosing a new filename. This creates a document using a blank template that you can then edit. The default template is <code>Data\Docs\My Readme Template</code> if it exists, or if not, <code>Data\Docs\Bash Readme Template.txt</code>. The latter is written in Wrye wiki text format, which will be displayed as HTML when the Doc Browser is not in edit mode.
<p>To view a different document, select a different plugin in the list on the left of the Doc Browser or in the Mods tab.
<p>Some notes on Doc Browser behaviour:
<ul>
    <li>If a plugin is renamed in the Mods tab, then any documents associated with it will become associated to the plugin's new name.
    <li>If a plugin is copied in the Mods tab, then any documents associated with it will also become associated with the copy.
    <li>Documents can be stored in any location, though <code>Data\Docs</code> is the standard location.
    <li>If you delete a plugin, its documentation will not be deleted, but it will no longer be viewable through the Doc Browser.
    <li>If you hide a plugin, its documentation will still be viewable through the Doc Browser.
</ul>

<figure>
<img src="../bash/images/readme/mod-checker-1.png" alt="Mod Checker"/>
<figcaption>Wrye Bash's Mod Checker</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The Mod Checker checks your active and merged plugins for errors, and provides warnings for any found, as well as configuration recaps and suggestions. It can be opened by clicking the <a href="Wrye%20Bash%20General%20Readme.html#launchersModChecker">Mod Checker button</a> in the status bar.
<p>At the top of the report is the Active Mod Files section, which lists your load order. It also displays any warnings that are applicable beneath the plugin(s) that they are applicable to. These warnings are either regarding missing masters or delinquent masters.
<ul>
    <li>Missing masters occur when a plugin that an active plugin depends on is not active. This results in an immediate CTD when the game is launched.
    <li>Delinquent masters occur when a plugin's master loads after the plugin itself. This should be fixed to prevent issues in-game.
</ul>
<p>The next section of the report details the output of any rulesets installed. These are text files that contain a set of instructions that tell the Mod Checker what to look for and what to say in the report if anything is found. Currently the only ruleset distributed by Wrye Bash is for Cobl. Rulesets are stored in <code>Data\Bash Patches</code> and end in <q>Rules.txt</q>. Information on ruleset syntax can be found at <a href="http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Tes4Mod:Wrye_Bash/Mod_Checker">UESP: Wrye Bash Mod Checker</a>.
<p>The rest of the report details any plugin groups that have been set up. Each group's section contains the following information:
<ul>
    <li>Notes: These are various notes on the plugin group, as entered by the user.
    <li>Configuration: This is a summary of the plugin group's configuration. It uses a few symbols to denote the status of plugins, these are: x: active; +: merged; *: imported; -: inactive/unmerged.
    <li>Suggestions: Specific suggestions for the plugin group. These are typically activating or deactivating certain plugins, or replacing mods with other mods.
    <li>Warnings: Like suggestions, but the causes are more likely to cause issues. This section will detail what should be activated or deactivated to resolve the problems.

<h3 id="tools-swapping">Oblivion.esm Swapping</h3>
<p>Oblivion.esm swapping is a feature that allows mod authors to switch between different versions of Oblivion.esm on the fly. This is useful as it allows mod authors to make plugins that are totally SI-independent (as the Shivering Isles patches Oblivion.esm instead of using a new plugin). It can also be used to avoid the need for a fully patched Oblivion to run a plugin, but this usage is <b>not recommended</b>. If you want a plugin to work on older versions of Oblivion, use the <a href="#modsVersion0.8">Version 0.8</a> command on it.
<p>The main requirement for swapping to work is that you have the necessary copies of the different Oblivion.esm files. <b>This is only possible if you copy and rename Oblivion.esm before installing Shivering Isles.</b> There are three accepted versions of Oblivion.esm in addition to the latest SI one. These are determined by their file size:
<ul>
    <li>247388848 bytes: this is the 1.1 version. Rename it to <code>Oblivion_1.1.esm</code>.
    <li>247388812 bytes: this is the GOTY version without SI. Rename it to <code>Oblivion_GOTY non-SI.esm</code>.
    <li>247388894 bytes: this is an uncommon variant of the 1.1 version. Rename it to <code>Oblivion_1.1b.esm</code>.
</ul>
<p>You can then swap between the different versions of Oblivion.esm using the <a href="#modsOblivion.esm">Oblivion.esm</a> submenu in the Mods tab column header context menu. Your currently active version will be checked, select another to swap them. You can also perform the same swapping in the Saves tab column header context menu, but in addition to the swapping this will also mark the selected version as the preferred version to use with the current <a href="#saves-profiles">Save Profile</a>. If you then switch to another save profile and back to this one, Oblivion.esm will be swapped automatically.
<p>Wrye Bash displays the current version of Oblivion.esm in its version indicators. The main indicator is in the title bar of the main Wrye Bash window, but there are also indicators placed after Oblivion.esm in the Mods tab plugin list, and after Oblivion.esm in the Masters tab for plugins and savegames. The three possible indicators are:
<ul>
    <li>[1.1]: You are currently using the 1.1 or 1.1b version of Oblivion.esm.
    <li>[GOTY non-SI]: You are currently using the GOTY without SI installed version of Oblivion.esm.
    <li>[SI]: You are currently using the Shivering Isles-patched version of Oblivion.esm.
</ul>


<h3 id="tools-shortcuts">Keyboard Shortcuts</h3>

<h3 id="tools-arguments">Command Line Arguments</h3>
<p>The following table lists all command-line arguments Wrye Bash
	understands.
<p>
<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Argument
			<th>Function
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td><code>-g&nbsp;GAMENAME, --game=GAMENAME</code>
			<td>Bash reads the windows registry to find supported games and
			checks the <code>-o</code> argument, the sOblivionPath ini option
			and the position of the Mopy folder (namely checks if Mopy's parent
			folder contains a supported game exe). If via any of the last three
			methods a path to a supported game is found then this game will be
			used, even if <code>-g</code> is not set. But in case those options
			are not set or a supported game exe (NB: only exe name is checked)
			is not found using them, Bash will prompt you to choose amongst the
			games found in the registry (if any) except if <code>-g</code> is
			set. <code>-g</code> takes precedence on the heuristics above which
			may lead to surprises.
		<tr>
			<td><code>-d, --debug</code>
			<td>Useful if bash is crashing on startup or if you want to
				print a lot of information (e.g. while developing or debugging).
			<td><code>-C, --Cbash-mode</code>
			<td>enables CBash and uses CBash to build the bashed patch.
		<tr>
			<td><code>-P, --Python-mode</code>
			<td>disables CBash and uses python code to build the bashed
				patch.
		<tr>
			<td><code>-L&nbsp;LANGUAGE, --language=LANGUAGE</code>
			<td>Specify the user language overriding the system language
				settings.
    <thead>
		<tr>
			<th>Path Arguments
			<th>All path arguments must be absolute paths and use either
				forward slashes (/) or two backward slashes (\\). All of these can
				also be set in the ini (where you can also use relative paths) and
				if set in both cmd line takes pecedence.
    <tbody>
		<tr>
			<td><code>-o&nbsp;OBLIVIONPATH,
					--oblivionPath=OBLIVIONPATH</code>
			<td>Specifies the game directory (the one containing the game's
			exe). Use this argument if Bash is located outside of the game
			directory and you have no ini option (or want to override it).
			Bash reads the windows registry to find supported games
			so this is not needed if the game entry is present in the registry.
			If however more than one game entries are present in the registry
			consider providing the <code>--game</code> argument to specify
			which one to use - otherwise Bash will prompt you.
    <thead>
		<tr>
			<th>User Directory Arguments
			<th>These arguments allow you to specify your user directories
				in several wasy. These are only useful if the regular procedure for
				geting the user directory fails. And even in that case, the user is
				probably better off installing win32com.
    <tbody>
		<tr>
			<td><code>-p&nbsp;PERSONALPATH,
					--personalPath=PERSONALPATH</code>
			<td>Specify the user's personal directory. (Like "C:\\Documents
				and Settings\\Wrye\\My Documents") If you need to set this then you
				probably need to set <code>-l</code> too.
		<tr>
			<td><code>-u&nbsp;USERPATH, --userPath=USERPATH</code>
			<td>Specify the user profile path. May help if HOMEDRIVE and/or
				HOMEPATH are missing from the user's environment.
		<tr>
			<td><code>-l&nbsp;LOCALAPPDATAPATH,

<h2 id="international">Internationalisation</h2>
<h3 id="international-overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Wrye Bash has built-in support for translation into other languages, using text files that tell it which English strings in the source code should be translated, and into what. These text files are found in <code>Mopy\bash\l10n\</code>. New translations or updates to existing translations should be presented to the Wrye Bash team so that they may be included in future releases.
<p>To begin translating, or to update an existing translation, use the following steps.
<ol>
    <li>Select <a href="#settingsDumpTranslator">Dump Translator</a> from Wrye Bash's Settings menu. This generates a new version of the translation file for your locale. The new file will be named appropriately, except from the leading "NEW", and will contain any translations already done.
    <li>Delete any existing translation text file for the same language.
    <li>Rename the new translator file, removing the leading "NEW". Do not change the rest of the filename.
    <li>Edit the translator file, adding translations or editing existing translations.
    <li>To test a translator file, save your changes then restart Wrye Bash, and select the language from the <a href="#settingsLanguage">Language</a> submenu in Wrye Bash's Settings menu.
</ol>


<h3 id="international-format">Translator File Format</h3>
<p>Below is an excerpt from a translator file.
<code class="box">=== basher.py, 3711
Active profile cannot be removed.
>>>>

=== basher.py, 3717
Delete profile %s and the %d save files it contains?
>>>>
DELETE PROFILE %s AND THE %d SAVE FILES IT CONTAINS?
</code>
<p>The above contains two separate translation entries. Each entry begins with the source code file and line number the string to be translated is found on.
<p>The file line is followed by the original text string on a new line, which is then followed by a line containing only <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>. The translation entry ends with a final line containing the translated text string.
<p><b>Note:</b> It is important that the formatting characters are not removed or moved or added to. Formatting characters are those that start with a percentage sign or a backslash, eg. <code> %s %d %08X \n</code>. If a formatting character is missing, Wrye Bash will throw an exception, which is bad.
