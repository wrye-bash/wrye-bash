<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
<p>Wrye Bash is a powerful mod management utility for TES IV: Oblivion, Fallout 3, Fallout New Vegas, TES V: Skyrim, Fallout 4 and SSE: Skyrim Special Edition. Its features include:
<ul>
    <li>A mod installation and conflict manager
    <li>A plugin load order manager
    <li>Increased mod compatibility
    <li>Lifting of the 255 plugin limit through automatic merging of compatible mods
    <li>.ini and settings files tweak management
    <li>Screenshot management
    <li>Many, many more features
</ul>
<p>Wrye Bash can appear daunting at first. To help make it more manageable, the documentation has been split into a few readmes that are targeted towards different usage requirements.
<p>A companion to the <a href="Wrye%20Bash%20General%20Readme.html">General Readme</a>, this document details those features
    that were omitted from the aforementioned readme. These features are often more specialised, advanced or complicated, and
    many are geared more towards mod authors than mod users. This readme is also more technical and goes into more depth on
    how Wrye Bash functions. It assumes the reader has previously read the General Readme.
<p>Note that the <a href="#people">People</a> tab is hidden by default. You can toggle the visibility of the tabs in Wrye Bash's main tab bar by right-clicking the tab bar and checking or unchecking the options in the context menu displayed.

<h3 id="intro-title">Title Bar Info</h3>
<p>As a quick note that doesn't really belong anywhere else, Wrye Bash's title bar contains some useful information. The title is formatted as:
<p><code>Wrye Bash [Bash Version] [Install Type] [Game Modifier], Cbash v[CBash Version]: [Save Profile] [Version Indicator]</code>
<p>The square bracketed information is:
<ul>
    <li><code>[Bash Version]</code>: This is the version number for the version of Wrye Bash running. Useful when troubleshooting.
    <li><code>[Install Type]</code>: If the Python version is running, this will read <q>Python</q>. If the Standalone version is running, it will read <q>(Standalone)</q>. See the <a href="#install">Installation</a> section for more information.
    <li><code>[Game Modifier]</code>: If the option is selected in the <a href="Wrye%20Bash%20Advanced%20Readme.html#tools-settings">Settings menu</a>,
    this will display <q>for Oblivion</q>, <q>for Skyrim</q> or <q>for Fallout</q> depending on the game it is being run for.
    <li><code>[CBash Version]</code>: This is the version number for the version of CBash included with the Wrye Bash install. Useful when troubleshooting. See the <a href="#patch">Setting Up A Bashed Patch</a> section for more information.
    <li><code>[Save Profile]</code>: This is the name of the <a href="Wrye%20Bash%20Advanced%20Readme.html#saves-profiles">save profile</a> Wrye Bash is currently using. By default it is <q>Default</q>.
    <li><code>[Version Indicator]</code>: This is only displayed when Wrye Bash is running for Oblivion. It indicates the version of Oblivion.esm currently being used. This is related to the <a href="Wrye%20Bash%20Advanced%20Readme.html#tools-swapping">Oblivion.esm Swapping</a> feature.
</ul>

<h2 id="install">Advanced Installation</h2>
<h3 id="install-alternate">Alternative Install Locations</h3>
<p>Wrye Bash can be installed in any folder, and actually if you do manage multiple games the preferred way of installing Bash is to have a
    single installation and redirect Bash via the command line and/or ini. But in this case you must tell Bash where the game folder is.
    Bash checks (in this order) the <code>-o</code> argument, the sOblivionPath ini option and the position of the Mopy folder (namely
    checks if Mopy's parent folder contains a supported game exe). The first of those three methods that yields a path to a supported game
    exe will "win" and this game will be used. But in case those options are not set or a supported game exe (NB: only exe name is checked)
    is not found using them, Bash reads the windows registry to find supported games. If no games are found in the registry Bash will notify
    you and exit. If one game is found then Bash will use that. If however more than one games are found Bash will prompt you to choose
    amongst those games.
<p>So if you have installed Bash outside of a game folder (recommended for multi-game installs), and you don't want to be prompted (or your
    games do not figure in the registry) you have to either launch Wrye Bash with the -o argument or set the bash.ini <q>sOblivionPath</q>
    setting.

<p>To set the OblivionPath bash.ini option:
<ol>
    <li>Open <code>bash_default.ini</code> in the <code>Mopy</code> folder and save it as <code>bash.ini</code>.
    <li>In the new bash.ini, enter the full path of your game's installation folder (the one that contains the game's executable) for the <q>sOblivionPath</q> setting.
    <li>Save the edited bash.ini.
</ol>
<p>Alternatively, you can launch Wrye Bash with the -o argument, quoting the path as the argument's parameter. Note that backslashes must be doubled as Python treats a single backslash as an escape character. For example, <code>"Wrye Bash Launcher.pyw" -o "C:\\Games\\Oblivion\\"</code> if you are running Wrye Bash for Oblivion.

<p>For more settings (such as changing the Wrye Bash Installers Path), please read the Bash_Default.ini.


<h3 id="install-components">Python Components</h3>
<p>If you are installing the Python version of Wrye Bash and wish to install the Python dependencies separately, the following must be installed.
<p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; font-size: 1em; color: red;">Note that the 32-bit versions are required even if you are on a 64-bit operating system.
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.12/python-2.7.12.msi">Python 2.7.12</a>:  Versions prior to 2.7.12 may work with Wrye Bash, but have not been tested.  Updating is recommended for bug and security fixes.
    <li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/wxpython/files/wxPython/2.8.12.1/wxPython2.8-win32-unicode-2.8.12.1-py27.exe">wxPython 2.8.12.1 Unicode for Python 2.7</a>: (do <b>not</b> get a newer version)
    <li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/Build%20220/pywin32-220.win32-py2.7.exe/download">PyWin32</a>: This component is required for Wizards to function. If you do not wish to use Wizards, then it need not be installed.
    <li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/comtypes/files/comtypes/0.6.2/comtypes-0.6.2.win32.exe/download">Comtypes 0.6.2</a>: This is an optional component, it is used to enable rendering of HTML via an ActiveX control.  The  following features are affected if comtypes is not installed:
        <ul>
            <li>The DocBrowser will display raw text when displaying an HTML readme.
            <li>The ModChecker report will be text instead of HTML.
            <li>The Bashed Patch build report will be displayed by opening the file in your default browser.
        </ul>
    <li><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/scandir">scandir</a>: Optional but highly recommended module (in the standard library since
    python 3.5).Scandir speeds up disk I/O operations (namely os. walk) by 5-50x on the Windows operating system family. There are several
    ways to install Scandir, in levels of increasing complexity
  <ul>
    <li>The first is to download the Scandir wheel file (.whl)&nbsp; and install it using the Pip command line tool.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Browse to the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/scandir" target="_blank">official Python Scandir page</a> and download <a href="https://pypi.python.org/packages/ad/ba/72797d0d2cd7b9d2a2ca06bce94f59b8864dc737548c8169bbdf90be22ff/scandir-1.6-cp27-cp27m-win32.whl#md5=369517d3cd6d189afaefe7149adecc92" target="_blank">scandir-1.6-cp27-cp27m-win32.whl</a> or newer. Remember the path to the download location on your hard disk.&nbsp; For this example we will use "C:\Downloads\".
      <li>Open a Windows command or Powershell prompt and issue the <code>command python.exe -m pip install C:\Downloads\scandir-1.6-cp27-cp27m-win32.whl</code>
      <li>Follow the instructions on screen if any appear.
    </ul>
    <li>The second method is to install Scandir via the Python pip package manager.
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>Open a Windows command prompt or Powershell prompt.
      <li>Issue the command <code>python.exe -m pip install --upgrade scandir</code>
      <ul>
        <li>You may be asked to install the 'Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for Python 2.7'. In this event, download and install the compiler from the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44266" target="_blank">official Microsoft download page</a>.
        <li>You may also be asked to install Python "setuptools". To install setuptools, issue the command (from within the same command prompt is fine) <code>python.exe -m pip install --upgrade setuptools</code>
        <li>Once these two tools are installed the installation should proceed as expected.
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>

<h3 id="install-loot-api">LOOT API</h3>
<p>Wrye Bash comes with the LOOT API Python Module v1.2.0 bundled, but Python users can update to a more recent compatible version if one is available. To do so:
<ol>
    <li>Check if a more recent v1.x release is available on <a href="https://github.com/loot/loot-api-python/releases">GitHub</a>. Releases with a different major version number (releases are major.minor.patch) than the version Wrye Bash bundles are incompatible and cannot be upgraded to.
    <li>Download and extract the release's <code>*.7z</code> file.
    <li>Make sure Wrye Bash is not running.
    <li>Copy the <code>loot_api.dll</code> and <code>loot_api.pyd</code> files you extracted into your Wrye Bash's <code>Mopy</code> folder, replacing the existing files.
    <li>Start Wrye Bash.
</ol>
<p>Standalone users cannot upgrade their bundled LOOT API because its <code>loot_api.pyd</code> file is compiled into the standalone executable.

<h2 id="bain">Installers Tab</h2>
<h3 id="bain-ui">The User Interface In Detail</h3>
<p>The Installers tab is split into three main sections: on the left is the Package List, and the right is split between the Information Tabs at the top and the Comments field at the bottom. The Information Tabs and Comments sections display information specific to the currently selected package. Much of the contents of the Information Tabs depends on the install status and order of the package. The information tabs are detailed in the table below.
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr><th colspan="2">Information Tabs
        <tr><th>Tab<th>Description
    <tbody>
        <tr><td>General<td>Shows summary info and the files to be installed, as determined by sub-package, esp/m, voice filtering, etc.
        <tr><td>Matched<td>Shows files which are identical to current Data directory files.
        <tr><td>Missing<td>Files which are missing from the Data directory.
        <tr><td>Mismatched<td>Files which are present in the data directory, but which aren't identical to the selected package's version of those files.
        <tr><td>Conflicts<td>Shows which other packages will conflict the current package and for what files. Note that if a given file is mismatched, but the mismatch isn't due to other packages, then it won't appear. This report can be modified to show inactive conflicts and lower order conflicts by enabling the <a href="#bainShowInactiveConflicts">Show Inactive Conflicts</a> and <a href="#bainShowLowerConflicts">Show Lower Conflicts</a> options respectively.
        <tr><td>Underidden<td>Shows packages which should be overridden, but are not, due to install order errors. This can be corrected by running <a href="#bainAnneal">Anneal</a> or <a href="#bainAnnealAll">Anneal All</a>.
        <tr><td>Dirty<td>Shows files which the selected package previously installed, but which now should be removed or altered due to a reconfiguration of the package. Dirty files can be cleared by running <a href="#bainAnneal">Anneal</a> or <a href="#bainAnnealAll">Anneal All</a>.
        <tr><td>Skipped<td>Shows which files in the selected package were <a href="#bain-skipped">skipped</a> by Bain.
</table>
<p>The Comments field is provided as an area in which notes may be kept on packages. It is useful for keeping track of what packages do, what your favourite install options are, etc.


<h3 id="bain-refresh">BAIN Refresh</h3>
<p>To perform its magicks BAIN needs to know what's inside two directories: the game Data/ directory and its subdirectories and the Bash Installers folder (where the packages are). The Data
    directory scanning is done once per run of Wrye Bash, when the Installers tab is first opened, because walking this potentially huge directory and checking sizes and modification times
    does take a while. The Bash Installers folder however will be scanned whenever the installers tab regains focus after losing it (ie. you select another program's window, then switch back
    to Wrye Bash, or you switch to another tab then back to installers tab). This automatic scanning just checks modification times and sizes of installers inside Bash Installers folder to
    decide if any package changed, and should usually be very fast (although noticeable). There is a catch however: this check is almost instantaneous for packages (archives) but for biggish
    projects takes a while as Bash needs to scan modification times and sizes for <i>all</i> files inside the project. To make this (automatic) scan faster two options are provided for
    projects: <a href="#bainDontRefresh">Don't Refresh</a> (on the project's context menu) and <a href="#bainAutoRefreshProjects">Auto-Refresh Projects</a> (on the global menu). If a project
    is affected by these options Bash will skip over it when scanning Bash Installers directory and changes inside the project's dir have to be detected manually. However the initial refresh
    (on booting BAIN) will ignore those skip flags and will scan all project directories for changes (comparing their sizes and modification times with the ones it loads from Installers.dat).
<p>However, changes in files in the Data directory will have to be manually detected after initial refresh, as in this scenario:

<ol>
    <li>Install a mod from some package.
    <li>Go to the installers tab. Note the package is marked green.
    <li>Go back to the mods tab and edit the mod using xEdit or the CK/CS/etc.
    <li>Return to the installers tab. The package is still marked green instead of being marked as out of sync with the data.
</ol>

<p>This is because, as already mentioned, the refresh of the game <i>Data</i> directory is performed once on boot, so modifying/deleting/adding files in the game directory will not be detected
    afterwards, except in some few scenarios - notably, deleting an espm from inside Bash will notify BAIN (add more actions is in the TODOs).
<p>BAIN provides several menu items for manually refreshing for the scenarios above (and others). What you most likely need is <a href="#bainQuickRefresh">Quick Refresh</a>. See also
    <a href="#bainFullRefresh">Full Refresh</a>, <a href="#bainRefreshData">Refresh Data</a> and <a href="#bainRefresh">Refresh</a>.
<p>Technical: This situation is a limitation of our refresh model which is basically polling the directories for changes. We should switch to an event based refresh but the code is not yet
    ready (see <a href="https://github.com/wrye-bash/wrye-bash/issues/265">relevant issue</a>).


<h3 id="bain-skipped">Skipped Files</h3>
<p>BAIN skips the installation of some files and directories. The types of files skipped are:
<ul>
    <li>Silent skips. These are <i>not</i> listed on the <q>Skipped</q> panel on the right and are:
        <ul>
            <li><code>thumbs.db</code> and <code>desktop.ini</code> files
            <li>any path that ends in <code>config</code>
            <li>the omod conversion directory (<code>omod conversion data</code>, <code>fomod</code>) if on the top level of package or subpackage
            <li>the <code>wizard images</code> directory (again if on the top level of package or subpackage)
            <li>Developer files. Any file or directory that begins with <code>'--'</code> and is at the top level of a package or a subpackage will be silently skipped. This is so that mod
                authors can include files related to a mod that are not required for it to work (eg. screenshots) in packages.
            <li>Bash will also skip voices for espms that are not installed from complex installers
            <li>Specified skips. There are a few options in BAIN to skip the installation of certain file types, namely the ones on the <a href="#bainGlobalSkips">Global Skips</a> submenu for
            all installers and <a href="#bainSkipVoices">Skip Voices</a> (on a per installer basis). If any such options are enabled, the file type(s) in question will be <i>silently</i>
            skipped.
        </ul>
    <li>Non-standard directories. Standard directories include all the game's default directories (including those only found in BSAs by default) - see
    <a href="Wrye%20Bash%20General%20Readme.html#bain-structure">BAIN-Compatible installer layout</a> for a detailed list per game. Files skipped because of this will be
    listed in the <q>Skipped</q> panel on the right on the <i>== Skipped (Dir)</i> section. Installation of non-standard directories may be forced by using the <a
            href="#bainHasExtraDirectories">Has Extra Directories</a> option. Even if Has Extra Directories option is checked, directories that are silently skipped will still be skipped.
    <b>For a complex package,</b> any top level files (with the exception of files that contain "readme" and variations in their name) will be also considered as belonging to a skipped directory
    and will be listed in the '== Skipped (Dir)' section. Top level means at the subpackages level, not inside a subpackage.
    <li>Archives &amp; executables. Executable files, apart from Script Extender plugins if the <a href="#bainSkipOBSEPlugins">Skip OBSE Plugins</a> option is disabled, and archives in
    packages will be skipped. Files skipped because of this will be listed in the <q>Skipped</q> panel on the right on the <i>== Skipped (Extension)</i> section. The complete list of
    extensions skipped is:
    <code>.001, .7z, .7z.001, .ace, .bz2, .db, .exe, .fomod, .gz, .lzma, .manifest, .omod, .py, .pyc, .rar, .tar, .tb2, .tgz, .zip</code>
    This includes BCFs (they have a .7z extension) - still BAIN will detect those.
    <li>Espm files that are not in top level of the package/subpackage. It makes no sense to have those files in a subfolder, so those are skipped.
</ul>


<h3 id="bain-data-dir-skipped">Skipped Data subdirectories and uninstall quirks</h3>
<p>When scanning the contents of the Data folder BAIN will skip some of its subdirectories either by default or based on <a href="#bainGlobalSkips">Global Skips</a> in the installer

<p>Skipping of Data subdirectories has some implications vis-à-vis uninstalling those skipped files. So say you turn Skip DistantLOD on, all packages
    that have installed files in Data/distantlod will show as dirty (as expected). You should at this point hit
    <a href="#bainAnnealAll">Anneal All</a>. If you don't, then restart Bash, the files will no more show as dirty (remember Bash scans the data dir on
    booting, and will now boot with Skip DistantLOD on, so will simply loose track of any files in the distantlod folder). If you want to uninstall
    those files after a restart you should turn <a href="#bainOverrideSkips">Override Skips</a> on for the package, so that BAIN will re-detect the
    skipped files for this package and be able to uninstall them.


<h3 id="bain-se">Script Extender Plugin Installation</h3>
<p>Script Extender (OBSE, SKSE) plugins (.dll, .dlx extensions) may be installed through BAIN if the following conditions are met:
<ul>
    <li>The package (or subpackage in the case of a Complex Bain) contains the OBSE plugin file inside <code>OBSE\Plugins\</code> (for
        Oblivion), or <code>SKSE\Plugins\</code> (for Skyrim) sub-folders.
    <li>The <a href="#bainSkipOBSEPlugins">Skip OBSE Plugins</a> option found in the Installers tab column header context menu is disabled.
</ul>
<p>When attempting to install a specific Script Extender plugin for the first time, Wrye Bash will display a warning dialogue and ask you to confirm or deny the plugin's installation. Thereafter you can uninstall and install the plugin as you like without seeing the warning. These additional requirements are due to the significant (though currently theoretical) dangers of installing executable files.
<p>The list of allowed and disallowed Script Extender plugins can be imported and exported using the <a href="#settingsImportList">Import list of allowed/disallowed OBSE plugin dlls</a> and <a href="#settingsExportList">Export list of allowed/disallowed OBSE plugin dlls</a> options in Wrye Bash's <a href="#tools-settings">Settings</a> menu.


<h3 id="bain-omod">OMOD Conversion Data</h3>
<p>If a mod author is building a mod that supports BAIN, manual and OMOD installs, they can use the <a href="#bainOmodInfo">Omod Info...</a> option in the package context menu to create or update the OMOD config file.
<p>If a mod author wishes to include a screenshot for use by the OMOD, they simply need to copy the screenshot saved as a JPEG to the OMOD Conversion Data folder and rename it to <q>screenshot</q> with no file extension.
<p>An OMOD installation script may also be created by creating a text file named <q>script.txt</q> and writing the script in any text editor. Testing is still best done in OBMM though.
<p>The OMOD config file is the only true requirement for an OMOD to be created from OMOD Conversion Data. The screenshot and installation script can be used to enhance an OMOD. Note that the <q>info.txt</q> file that OMODs create when exporting Conversion Data in OBMM is unnecessary, and is provided for purely informational purposes.


<h3 id="bain-bcf">BAIN Conversion Files</h3>
<p><abbr title="BAIN Conversion Files">BCFs</abbr> are effectively automated archive converters, converting an existing archive or several archives into a new layout. They can be used to make BAIN-incompatible archives compatible, or make compatible archives easier to install. As they don't contain any files that are found in the existing archive(s), the only copyright/permissions that apply are those that the BCF creator stipulates, which generally makes distribution easier. BCFs are also usually much smaller, only containing new files that it adds (commonly <q>package.txt</q> and ini file tweaks) and a <q>BCF.dat</q> that tells Wrye Bash how to reorganise the archive(s).
<p>To create a BCF:
<ol>
    <li>Add all of the source archives to BAIN.
    <li>Create a new project with the contents of the source archives, and rearrange the files as you see fit.
    <li>Right-click the project and select <a href="#bainPackToArchive">Pack To Archive...</a>.
    <li>Name the new archive, and choose whether to use solid compression or not. Solid compression results in smaller file sizes, but also reduces performance.
    <li>Set any options on the new archive package that you wish to be set whenever the BCF is applied (such as default sub-packages or <q>Skip...</q> options).
    <li>Select all the source archives in the package list, then right-click them and choose <a href="#bainConversion">Conversions->Create</a>. Select the archive that you just created, and name the BCF.
    <li>Look over the result log to make sure it looks OK. If it looks wrong, try again, you may have gotten the sources/target wrong. If it looks right, you can find the new BCF in <code>[Game] Mods\Bash Installers\Bain Converters</code>. It is recommended that you copy/paste the result log into your readme for your BCF.
</ol>
<p>Some points of interest regarding BCFs:
<ul>
    <li>BCFs must end in either <code>-BCF.7z</code> or <code>-BCF-*.7z</code> (where the * is a wildcard matching any character string).
    <li>The converted archive may use 7-zip (.7z) or Zip (.zip) compression.
    <li>BCFs support an arbitrary number and level of archives embedded within an archive.
    <li>BCFs store the configuration settings of the original converted archive used when creating the BCF, allowing authors to pre-select options (see instructions above).
    <li>BCFs found to be duplicates will be moved to <code>[Game] Mods\Bash Installers\Bain Converters\--Duplicates</code>.
    <li>BCFs use data CRCs to verify the integrity of source archives. These use the contents of an archive, but not the name or type of the archive, so a source archive may be renamed or recompressed without affecting its ability to be used by a BCF. Wrye Bash displays the data CRCs of packages on the General Info tab for this reason.
</ul>

<h3 id="bain-monitor">Monitor External Installation</h3>

<p>Wrye Bash can monitor your game's Data directory to detect any changes made by an external application or manual installation. It will
    take the new or changed files and create a new BAIN package that can be handled, installed, and uninstalled just like any other standard
    BAIN. This is very useful for mod authors or anyone that
    wants to keep strict control of what gets placed into their data directory.

<h4>Example usage scenarios</h4>

<ul>
    <li><b>Creation Kit/GECK monitoring</b>
- When creating or managing content in the Creation Kit or GECK, Wrye Bash can capture any output from the CK/GECK in a BAIN package. This
        is useful for example when capturing FaceGen data as NPCs are managed, and it will also capture any loose files, ESP, or BSA created in the
    editor.
    <li><b>BodySlide</b>
- BodySlide is a utility used to create custom bodies and armor to fit these bodies, as well as from armors by third-parties to a
    custom body. Wrye Bash can capture all output from BodySlide and package it into a BAIN for easy management. These files can then be
    packaged and distributed, backed up, or used to build another mod.
    <li><b>Nexus Mod Manager / Other Mod Managers</b>
- Since Wrye Bash does not currently support the Nexus Mod Manager FOMOD XML installer format, sometimes it is necessary to use the Nexus
    Mod Manager to install poorly packaged mods that cannot be installed via the usual "click the checkbox" BAIN methods. The monitor
    external installation feature watches as NMM installs files and captures any changes to the content of Data, which can then be
    uninstalled by NMM and reinstalled cleanly from the newly created BAIN with Wrye Bash instead.
</ul>

<h4>How to use the "Monitor External Installation" feature</h4>

<ol>
    <li>Launch Wrye Bash and switch to the Installers tab.</li>
    <li>At the top of any column (e.g. Packages), right click and select "Monitor External Installation..." from the context menu.</li>
    <li>Wrye Bash will then begin to scan your data directory to snapshot all data contained within it before any changes are made.</li>
    <li>Once this has completed, you will be prompted to begin your external installation.</li>
    <li>At this point, switch to your external application and perform the installation or content creation you intend to perform. There is
        no time limit.
    </li>
    <li>Once you have completed the task in the external application, switch back to Wrye Bash and click the OK button to proceed.</li>
    <li>Wrye Bash will scan the data folder again to calculate what files have changed, or what new files have been placed into your game's
        data directory.
    </li>
    <li>Once this has completed, Wrye Bash will present a dialog box with a list of files that are new or changed. You can select and
        deselect files to be included in the BAIN package at this point. It is advisable to exclude log files and other non-essential files
        from the final BAIN package.
    </li>
    <li>Click OK when you are ready to build the package.</li>
    <li>You will now be prompted for a name for your package. Enter a name and confirm.</li>
    <li>Wrye Bash will then create the package and run a final CRC scan on the newly created BAIN package to add it to the installer
        manifest. This will take a few seconds depending on the speed of your computer and the size of the data being packaged.
    </li>
    <li>The resulting project can be found at the bottom (highest number) of your package order on the Installer tab. You can then
        install, uninstall, or anneal the project as you would any other regular BAIN package, or zip it up as a BAIN archive.
    </li>
</ol>

<h4>Usage Notes</h4>

<ul>
    <li>When naming your new BAIN package it is safest to avoid spaces in the name (e,g. use underscores between words) as the created BAIN
        package is written to an actual folder on your hard drive.
    </li>
    <li>If you use Mod Organiser (or any mod manager that utilises a virtual installation of files instead of actually installing them into
        Data\), then Monitor External Installation can only be used if Wrye Bash is launched by the other Mod manager so that it will feed
        Wrye Bash the files it needs from the virtual folder. See <a
                href="https://github.com/wrye-bash/wrye-bash/wiki/Wrye-Bash-and-Mod-Organizer" target="_blank">this wiki article</a> for
        more information on integrating Wrye Bash with Mod Organizer.
    </li>
    <li>When installing mods via Nexus Mod Manager, it is recommended that you start monitoring, install the mod via NMM, then before
        closing NMM, complete the monitoring session. Create the BAIN package, then switch back to NMM and uninstall the mod. You can then
        close NMM. Switch back to Wrye Bash then install the mod from Wrye Bash. This ensures the mod is cleanly installed, all conflicts
        are recorded / resolved in Wrye Bash, and therefore able to be cleanly uninstalled.
    </li>
</ul>

            <a href="#bainRefresh">Refresh</a>) on, so in most use cases (if the files you altered belong to a particular project/package) just use Quick Refresh. What this command basically
            does is:
            <ol type="a">
                <li>rescan the game Data directory (as is done on booting BAIN). If you enabled/disabled any <a href="#bainGlobalSkips">global skip option</a> and this enabled/disabled new
                    skips in the Data dir then rescanning Data will take those skips into account. See <a href="#bain-data-dir-skipped">Skipped Data subdirectories</a> for the Data directories
                    that are skipped.
                <li>run a Quick refresh on all installers (ignoring Skip refresh flags for projects, as Quick Refresh does)

            </ul>
        The files are not deleted, but moved to the <code>[Game] Mods\Bash Installers\Bash\Data Folder Contents [timestamp]</code> folder instead, where <code>[timestamp]</code> is the date and time the command was run.

            <i>overridden</i>. BAIN used to try and do that automatically on refresh based on a setting (set by this column menu item), but this had many issues and was removed.
        <tr><td colspan="2" id="bainAvoidAtStartup">Avoid At Startup<td>Toggles Bash to avoid the Installers tab on startup, thus avoiding unnecessary data scanning. Unless you're spending a lot of time in the Installers tab, you should enable this.

            projects and you want to minimize the lag when you switch back to the installers tab, whereupon BAIN will (behind the scenes) scan the Bash Installers folder for changed
            projects/packages. While scanning packages (archives) is pretty fast, scanning projects is slow, however you will miss on updates done in the project directories (you will have to
            manually refresh) - so it's recommended to leave this enabled. If you are concerned about a particularly big project then consider enabling the <a href="#bainDontRefresh">Don't
                Refresh</a> flag <i>on that particular project</i>. Keep in mind that Projects will be anyway refreshed once on Bash restart, irrespective of this setting (except if popular

            also scan Bethsoft BSAs, ESPs, and ESMs. Disabling this option will cause a significant increase in refresh time if the
            timestamps on the Bethsoft BSAs are changed. However, disabling this setting is the only way to allow BAIN to install Vanilla
            ESPs, ESMs, and BSAs. For example, DLC plugins which have been cleaned with xEdit and packed into a BAIN. Preferred setting:
            enabled (that is, <i>skip</i> installation of bethsoft content).

            mod active in the load order.<em>Lower</em> and <em>Higher</em> conflicts has therefore a different meaning than loose file
            conflicts. Higher means that the corresponding active mod has a higher load oder number (loads later) so its bsa will load last
            and <i>its</i>assets will be used. Note that this may lead to a package having its bsas appear in both Higher and Lower sections

            <ul>
                <li> mod inis or the game ini are not taken into account when determining active bsas and their order
                <li> we can't open the resources and check if they actually conflict or are identical, so take those "conflicts" with a

<figcaption>The plugin details panel on the right hand side of the Mods tab.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The plugin details panel contains the following:
<table>
    <thead><tr><th>Item<th>Description
    <tbody>
        <tr><td>File Name<td>The filename of the selected plugin. Note that changing this does not change the filename in the Masters Lists of any dependent plugins.
        <tr><td>Modification Time<td>This field is editable, by clicking in the box. After changes are made, click the Save button to commit
            your changes to the plugin, or Cancel to discard them. Notes : For Oblivion, this affects the load order of the selected plugin.
            For Skyrim, it has no effect, except that if it is changed for a plugin obtained from Steam Workshop, it will cause the plugin
            to be redownloaded as Steam Workshop uses modification time to detect file versions. For Skyrim Special Edition, there was a bug
            at some point, with DLC Load Order being set by Date / Time Stamp (only the DLCs were affected by this). The only way to
            re-arrange your Skyrim SE DLC plugins Load Order was to edit their modification time, so that they follow each other by for
            example one minute. The bug was fixed in a later patch - but anyway Bash won't let you change neither the load order nor the
            modification times of the DLCs. The game always loads them before other masters and in the following order:
            Dawnguard / Hearthfire / Dragonborn. So Bash will timestamp them in one minute intervals following Skyrim/Update esms, so even
            the buggy patch behaves correctly.
        <tr><td>Author<td>Who made the selected plugin.
        <tr><td>Description<td>Commonly used for a short description of what the selected plugin does, plus the version number and any Bash Tags the author sets.
        <tr><td>Masters List<td>The Masters list show the plugins (.esm or .esp) that the currently selected plugin depends on, the load order
        (Mod Index) of that master in the plugin file, and the current load order of the master plugin if present and active.<br /><br />
        Plugins' entries in the Masters List may be renamed to reflect name changes of the plugins themselves. To rename a master, first allow editing from the
        masters list column context menu and then either left-click the plugin entry and edit it in the column display, or right-click the
        plugin and select <q>Change To...</q> then select the replacement plugin. <b>Do not</b> use this to change a plugin's masters to
        unrelated plugins, as this will cause file corruption.<br />
        If editing is allowed, items that are renamed inside Bash internal dictionaries appear <b>bolded</b> - on clicking on the masterlist they
        take their renamed values and the <i>Save</i> and <i>Cancel</i> buttons are enabled. You may click on Save to save the new master list,
        or on Cancel to revert displaying the non renamed masters.<br />
        Disallowing edits will revert the list to the original and disable Save and Cancel buttons (if no other fields are edited).<br />
        <tr><td>MI<td>Master Index of the mod. This means the actual number of the masters in succession starting with 00 Skyrim.esm, or 00 Oblivion.esm.<br />
        <tr><td>Current LO<td>Current load order in relation to the load order of the Active Plugins. Active Plugins should correspond with plugins.txt.
        <tr><td>Bash Tags<td>This field lists any Bash Tags that are assigned to the selected plugin. Right-clicking will display a list of Bash Tags and allow you to add or remove tags by checking or unchecking them.

<h3 id="mod-masters-symbols">Color scheme for Plugin Masters (MI &amp; Current LO)</h3>

<p>In the table below suppose you see details for displayed_mod.esp which depends on [Oblivion.esm, displayed_mod.esm, some_other.esp, some_other2.esp]
    in this order. So the MIs displayed in the master list for Oblivion.esm, displayed_mod.esm, some_other.esp, some_other2.esp are 0, 1, 2, 3.
<table>
    <thead>
        <tr><th>Checkbox Colour<th>Meaning
    <tbody>
        <tr><td><img src="../bash/images/checkbox_blue_on.png" alt="Blue"/><td>Good. Matches the Master Index of the the Current load order.
        <tr><td><img src="../bash/images/checkbox_green_on.png" alt="Green"/><td>Good, but the Master Index is not in sync with the Current
            load order.<br />
            <br />So for instance if you have a load order with active mods (in this order) [Oblivion.esm, displayed_mod.esm, yet_some-other.esp,
            some_other.esp, some_other2.esp, displayed_mod.esp], some_other.esp will display in green as its current load order is 3 while its
            master index is 2. Note that the <em>relative load order of masters</em> is the same as it is in the MI list.
        <tr><td><img src="../bash/images/checkbox_orange_on.png" alt="Orange"/><td>The plugin loads in a different order compared to its order in
            the master array of displayed_mod.esp<br />
            <br />So for instance if you have a load order with active mods (in this order) [Oblivion.esm, displayed_mod.esm, some_other2.esp,
            some_other.esp, displayed_mod.esp], some_other.esp and some_other2.esp will display in orange as they load in different
            <em>relative order</em> than they are recorded in the master array of displayed_mod.esp.<br />
        <br />If a plugin has two masters that are siblings (one doesn't have the other as a master, so they can load in either order) and they are overriding the same record from an earlier master (e.g. both are overriding a record from the main game master file), then loading them in a different order will result in a different version of the overridden record being the "winner". But the plugin might depend on the winner being the one indicated by the order in which it references the masters. The plugin should be examined in xEdit (meaning any version) to see if it is best to alter the load order or if Sort Masters should be used to correct the issue.
        <tr><td><img src="../bash/images/checkbox_red_on.png" alt="Red"/><td>A Master that is missing. If unintended then you should check to make
            sure that you have not inadvertently renamed or removed the plugin.
</table>

<h3 id="mods-csv">CSV Files</h3>
<p>Wrye Bash uses CSV files for many of its plugin data related features. CSV files are a very widely supported type of spreadsheet file, and once exported may be edited in programs like Microsoft Excel, LibreOffice Calc or even in text editors such as Notepad or Notepad++.
<p>CSV files are used by the Import/Export... commands as this allows much easier editing of record data in large batches or in systematic manners than in the Construction Set. The data may be exported, edited in the CSV, then imported again. The following notes apply to CSV files.
<ul>
    <li>Wrye Bash will ignore any lines in a CSV file for which the second column does not begin with <code>0x</code>, so such lines can be used for comments.
    <li>For Sigil Stones and Spell Stats CSV exports, additional effects can be added to a stone/spell by appending effects to the end of a line, leaving one blank column between each effect. If any of the Script Effect columns are set to <q>None</q> then all the script effects for that effect will be ignored.
    <li>For the values of object stats such as price or weight or damage, etc., formulae may be used to work out the numerical values, but the file should contain the resulting numbers, not the formulae used.
    <li>The faction lists for actors do not need to be complete - only the actor/faction pairs added or changed need to be listed. A rank of -1 in a faction will remove an actor from that faction.
    <li>Relation lists do not need to be complete for each faction - only the added/changed main/other pairs need to be listed.
</ul>
<p>CSV files can also be used when building the Bashed Patch, for a number of options. The Bashed Patch builder will automatically detect the presence of any CSV files in the <code>Data\Bash Patches</code> folder and have the correct filename ending. These filename endings are:
<table>
    <thead><tr><th>Import Type<th>Required Filename Ending

Auto-Ghosting adds a <q>.ghost</q> extension to all inactive plugins automatically to prevent the game engine reading them, and so helping to avoid the performance drop. When a ghosted plugin is activated, the <q>.ghost</q> extension is removed, allowing it to function as normal. Note that other utilities will not recognise ghosted plugins, so there are options available for individual plugins to control which get ghosted.

            used by Wrye Bash to highlight these plugins in the mod list. Checking this setting tells Wrye Bash to use this information if
            bundled version of LOOT is functional for this game. Note that the detection is based on user's LOOT install masterlists, if
            those are compatible with bundled LOOT, otherwise Bash falls back to the taglists it comes with.

This command replaces the Form IDs in a plugin according to a CSV file that acts as a Form ID mapper. An example of such a file is <code>Data\Bash Patches\TI to Cobl_Formids.csv</code>. The instructions below detail how to create a Form ID mapper.
            <ol>
                <li>Use <a href="#modsExportEditorIDs">Export Editor Ids</a> on both the plugin containing the Form IDs to be replaced and the plugin containing the replacement Form IDs.

                    <li>Old Mod. This supplies the first two digits in the old Form ID.
                    <li>Old Object. This supplies the rest of the old Form ID.
                    <li>Old Eid. The Editor ID for the old object.
                    <li>New Eid. The Editor ID for the new object.

                </ul>
                <p>Note that if either of the new or old sides of a row are empty, the row will be skipped. Also, the new object does not have to be of the same type as the old object, but they should be compatible.
                <li>Save the new CSV file so that its filename ends with <q>Formids.csv</q>.
            </ol>
            <p>If you've completely swapped from one base plugin to another, you may wish to remove the old dependency. This can be done using TES4Edit's <q>Clean Masters</q> command or TES4Gecko's <q>Edit Master List</q> command. The former only removes totally unused masters while the latter can remove used masters with the appropriate cleanup, and is not an automated procedure.
            <p><b>Note:</b> You can also use TES4Edit to change the Form IDs using its <q>Batch Change Referencing Records</q> command together with the CSV file created. TES4Edit will also change the definition of a Form ID, rather than just any references to it, unlike Wrye Bash.

            You should only use this if you know exactly what you're doing: adding a master through Bash does not update record FormIDs,
            so new content added by the mod will now seem added by the mod's new master (the "cedes ownership" part above) - resulting in
            the mod marked as mergeable - info from Arthmoor and Lojack here: http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1536340-wrye-bash-thread-105/page-3#entry24345148
            see previous posts for the confusion that this might cause. As Lojack points out if you're doing that sort of low level adding of masters,
            you should be using xEdit.

            extensions, but on a bit in the file. This command toggles this bit so that .esp files behave as .esm files and vice versa. It is
            useful for creating and editing plugins with .esp files as masters, which cannot be done in the Construction Set otherwise.
            Esm files cannot be edited in the Construction Set as esp files, so this command is disabled for them. NB: the file extension won't change
            and this is used by Bash so do not mess with it. <b>Warning:</b> Make sure to toggle any plugins back before playing the game, otherwise
            savegames will get confused, possibly causing bugs and corruption. To toggle the masters back use the same command on the plugin which

            but toggles a plugin's masters rather than the plugin itself. The load order of plugins will change to reflect their new status but
            since the modification time won't change they will revert back to their original positions for modification time based load orders.

<h2 id="patch">Advanced Bashed Patch</h2>
<p>You can have multiple Bashed Patches, though one is generally enough per <a href="#saves-profiles">save profile</a> or character. The only requirement for Wrye Bash recognising a plugin as a Bashed Patch is that its <q>Author</q> field is set to <q>BASHED PATCH</q>, so you can name a Bashed Patch whatever you want.
<h3 id="patch-view">Viewing &amp; Editing The Bashed Patch</h3>
<p>As the Bashed Patch commonly has .esp files as masters, viewing and editing it can be more complicated than for the average plugin. If you wish to view its contents, it is easiest to use <a href="http://oblivion.nexusmods.com/mods/11536">TES4Edit</a>, which can also be used to edit most types of data in plugins. To edit it using the Construction Set or Creation Kit (required when editing scripts), you'll need to first use the <a href="#modsEsmifyMasters">Esmify Masters</a> command on it. Be sure to use <q>Espify Masters</q> before attempting to play the game.

<h3 id="patch-tags">Bash Tags</h3>
<p>Wrye Bash uses a tagging system to determine what mods can and should have which records available for importing into the Bashed Patch. These Bash Tags are specified by mod authors in the header descriptions of their plugins, or are applied using data from LOOT's masterlist and userlist files.
In decreasing priority the Bash tags sources are:

<ol>
    <li>Manual Bash tags set by user in the Bash mod list
    <li>Header of ESP or ESM file (also can be edited in bash)
    <li>userlist.yaml (LOOT)
    <li>masterlist.yaml (LOOT)
    <li>taglist.yaml (LOOT)
</ol>

<p>Bash comes with the LOOT API Python Module bundled, currently version 1.2.0. It will try and parse the masterlist and userlist files, if it finds them in
    <code>C:\Users\USER\AppData\Local\LOOT\GAME</code> directory. If that fails (the files are not there or come from a different LOOT version than
    the one Bash bundles) it will fallback to the <code>Mopy\Bash Patches\GAME\taglist.yaml</code> file, also bundled, keep it there. For userlist
and masterlist relative priority and role see the LOOT docs.

<p>Bash Tags may also be set manually, by right-clicking a plugin's Bash Tags field in the Mods Tab sidebar and checking or unchecking tags in the list displayed. If you wish to revert to automatic tagging, choose <q>Automatic</q> in the right-click list. If you are a mod author, you may wish to use <q>Copy to Description</q> for your mod's plugins before releasing it to ensure that users have the tags applied automatically.

<p><b>Note:</b> A Bash Tag should only be applied when it is <b>important</b> that the plugin's change to whatever the Tag relates to is preserved. If a change your plugin makes is not important to the functioning of your mod, do not add a Bash Tag for it. Doing otherwise negates the purpose of the Bash Tag system.

<h3 id="patch-filter">Merge Filtering</h3>
<p>Merge filtering is an advanced option that allows records in a merged mod to be selectively filtered according to the current load order. For example, a patch mod could be created to rebalance weapons from several different weapon-adding mods. This feature would allow the patch to be used even if you didn't use all the mods, and the Bashed Patch would just apply the bits for the mods you do use. This saves the need for a separate patch plugin for each mod.
<p>Merge filtering has requisite conditions that must be fulfilled for a plugin to take advantage of it, and some limitations. These conditions and limitations are:
<ul>
    <li>The plugin must be mergeable and tagged with <code>Filter</code>.
    <li>The plugin must not be active at the time the patch is built. Note that if the user doesn't have all the plugin's masters installed, it will have to remain deactivated at all times.
    <li>Filtering is done according to the currently active plugins: it is therefore very important that all the desired plugins are active when the Bashed Patch is built.
    <li>Filtering is mostly limited to the top level, ie. if the plugin a record is from is missing, the record will be skipped. However, if a record references another record, and the latter's plugin is missing, the former will not be skipped, and the Bashed Patch will end up dependent on the latter's plugin being installed.
    <li>There are a few exceptions to the above limitation: entries in leveled lists will be filtered, as will spells, factions and items referenced in Creature and NPC records.
</ul>


<h3 id="patch-iim">Item Interchange Mode</h3>
<p>Item Interchange Mode is a 'hack' (a horribly inelegant and inconsistent implementation of a feature that nonetheless works) to support Vacuity's Item Interchange mod.
<p>Activation of the mode for a plugin relies on the following conditions:
<ul>
    <li>The plugin is tagged with <code>IIM</code>.
    <li>The plugin is being merged into the Bashed Patch.
    <li>The plugin is tagged with <code>Filter</code>.
</ul>
<p>Item Interchange Mode has the following effects:
<ul>
    <li>Prevents the records in the plugin from being merged into the Bashed Patch, apart from leveled list records, which are merged in.
    <li>Prevents all the patch components except from the Leveled Lists and Import Inventory from even looking at the plugin.
    <li>Causes Import Inventory to ignore all changes in the plugin except inventory changes.
</ul>


<h3 id="patch-tweaks">Tweak Options In Detail</h3>
<p>Each <q>Tweak...</q> section has a table below that details the options found within it.
<p>Tweaks are game dependant, most apply for Oblivion, not all of them will be available for Skyrim / Fallout.

    <tbody>
        <tr><td>Bigger Nords and Orcs<td>Adjusts the Orc and Nord race records (including mod added races named Orc/Nord) to be taller/heavier - to be more lore friendly. Three choices available - MMM settings, RBP settings or standalone Bigger Nords and Orcs settings.
        <tr><td>Merge Eyes From Similar Races<td>Merges eye lists from similar races ie RBP Khajiit eyes to Elsweyr Khajiits etc.
        <tr><td>Merge Hairs From Similar Races<td>Merges hair lists from similar races ie RBP Khajiit hair to Elsweyr Khajiits etc.
        <tr><td>Playable Eyes<td>Sets all eyes to be playable.
        <tr><td>Playable Hairs<td>Sets all hairs to be playable.
        <tr><td>Races Have All Eyes<td>Gives all races all eyes - although Googly Eye scanning/removal takes place after this so the final patch will not have all eyes for all races.
        <tr><td>Races Have All Hairs<td>Gives all races all hairs.
        <tr><td>Sexless Hairs<td>Sets all hairs to be useable by both male and female characters.

        <tr><td>As Intended: Boars<td>Adds the Bethesda Boar Resistances spells to all boars (found by the UOP team, based off of a mod made by Tejon).
        <tr><td>As Intended: Imps<td>Adds the Bethesda Imp Resistances spells to imps (found by the UOP team, based off of a mod made by Tejon). May choose to apply to all imps, only full size imps, or only implings.
        <tr><td>Irresponsible Creatures<td>Sets responsibility to 0 for all/specified creatures - so they can't report you for crimes.
        <tr><td>Mayu's Animation Overhaul Skeleton Tweaker<td>Sets NPC skeletons paths to match that required for MAO to work. <b>Requires</b> Mayu's Animation Overhaul or it will almost certainly cause CTDs.
        <tr><td>No Bloody Creatures<td>Nulls the blood records of all creatures; acts like 'Mart's Monster Mod - No Blood.esp' except it is universal and doesn't work with MMM (MMM uses a different system - it won't cause any harm if used with MMM, it will just have pretty much no effect).
        <tr><td>Quiet Feet<td>Removes all/some 'foot' sounds from creatures; on some computers can have a significant performance boost.
        <tr><td>Real Walk for female NPCs<td>Changes all female NPCs to use Mur Zuk's Real Walk. <b>Requires</b> Mur Zuk's Real Walk animation file.
        <tr><td>Redguard FGTS Nuller<td>Sets Redguard NPC FGTS subrecords to null; for use with Better Redguards.
        <tr><td>Sexy Walk for female NPCs<td>Changes all female NPCs to use Mur Zuk's Sexy Walk. <b>Requires</b> Mur Zuk's Sexy Walk animation file.
        <tr><td>VadersApp's Oblivion Real Bodies Skeleton Tweaker<td>Changes all (modded and vanilla) NPCs to use diverse skeletons for different look. Not compatible with MAO. <b>Requires</b> VadersApp's Oblivion Real Bodies.
        <tr><td>Vanilla Beast Skeleton Tweaker<td>Sets any NPCs using the vanilla non-beast skeleton path (skeleton.nif) to use the beast skeleton patch (skeletonbeast.nif). This avoids bugs when a mod changes the race of an NPC to a beast race without setting the skeleton path to the beast path, in which case the tail will appear to extend forever and weird stuff like that.

        <tr><td>Bow Reach Fix<td>Some of the bows in Oblivion (and a few in user mods) have a reach of zero. Due to a bug in the Oblivion engine, if these bows are equipped by an NPC, the game will crash. This patch changes bows with zero reach to have reach of 1.

        <tr><td>Disable Wind<td>Sets wind speed for all weathers to 0; this means that bushes and trees don't move in the wind since there isn't any. May help on machines with low end graphic cards.
        <tr><td>Faction Crime Gold Multplier Fix<td>Fix factions with unset crimeGoldMultiplier to have a crimeGoldMultiplier of 1.0.
        <tr><td>Harvest Chance<td>Sets the harvest chance of all flora to the desired chance.
        <tr><td>Magic: Script Effect Silencer<td>Script Effects will be silenced and have no graphics.

        <tr><td>No Light Flicker<td>Turns off flickering effects for lights. May help on machines with low end graphic cards.
        <tr><td>Number of uses for pre-enchanted weapons and Staffs/Staves<td>The charge amount and cast cost will be edited so that all enchanted weapons and staffs have the amount of uses specified. Cost will be rounded up to 1 (unless set to unlimited) so number of uses may not exactly match for all weapons.
        <tr><td>Nvidia Fog Fix<td>Ensures that cells have at least one non-zero fog value. For avoiding the Nvidia fog-related black screen. This feature is based on <a href="http://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/11167/?">Quarn's Nvidia Black Screen Fix</a>.
        <tr><td>Reweigh: Arrows<td>Reweighs arrows to a maximum weight.
        <tr><td>Reweigh: Ingredients<td>Reweighs ingredients to a maximum weight.
        <tr><td>Reweigh: Potions (Maximum)<td>Reweighs potions to a maximum weight. This does not affect potions with script effects or with current weight >= 1.0. Thus it should not affect alcoholic beverages or scripted "potions" like HTS water skins. Note that this is similar to, but not the same as, the Reweigh Potions command for savegames, which reweighs user created potions rather than mod created potions.
        <tr><td>Reweigh: Potions (Minimum)<td>Reweighs potions to a minimum weight.
        <tr><td>Reweigh: Staffs/Staves<td>Reweighs staves to a maximum weight.
        <tr><td>Right Hand Rings<td>Makes rings behave more consistently by making all rings prefer to be on the right hand. With this tweak activated, rings will only equip to the left hand if the right hand has a ring, but the left hand does not. You can use this to make one ring permanently equipped - just equip it to the left hand and it will stay on until you specifically unequip it.
        <tr><td>Set Sound Attenuation Levels<td>The sound attenuation levels will be set to tweak%*current level, thereby increasing (or decreasing) the sound volume (lower attenuation = higher volume).
        <tr><td>Set Sound Attenuation Levels: Nirnroots Only<td>The sound attenuation levels will be set to tweak%*current level, thereby increasing (or decreasing) the sound volume (lower attenuation = higher volume). This one only affects Nirnroots.
        <tr><td>Skyrim-style Weapons<td>Sets all one handed weapons as blades, two handed weapons as blunt.
        <tr><td>Uniform Groundcover<td>Eliminates the random variation in groundcover (grass, vines, shrubs, etc). Tall groundcover will still be taller than short groundcover, but there will be less variation in size. May help on lower end machines.

        <tr><td>Max Weight Rings<td>Sets the maximum weight of rings in the game. Rings with higher weights will have their weight set to this value.
        <tr><td>Robes Show Amulets<td>Forces all robes to show amulets.

<p><b>Tweak Settings Note</b> in some cases for newer games the following Tweaks may become a permanent part of your saves, and so should be
    set prior to starting a new game. <br/>Trying to change the same settings in a continued game by rebuilding your bashed patch may fail
    for games newer than Oblivion, because the game setting will always be loaded from your ongoing save files ( which the game loads last,
    after the Bashed Patch ). <br/>For example Timescale once you change it, is known to become permanently baked in your save game for
    Skyrim / Skyrim SE, it can be set once, but thereafter is part of your saves, and can only be changed by console command or starting a
    new game.

<h3 id="patch-lists">Leveled Lists</h3>
<p>The leveled list patcher is slightly odd in comparison to the others: it's effectively an <q>Import...</q> patcher, but its options are decided automatically by default.
<p>First, a bit of background. When different plugins alter the same leveled list, only the last loaded plugin's changes get applied. This tends not to be what is wanted. The leveled list patcher circumvents the issue by instead merging all the changes made to leveled lists and having this merged set of changes applied.
<p>The leveled list merging is dictated by related Bash Tags, and functions as follows.
<ul>
    <li>The load order of plugins is still important to the result of the leveled list patcher. It decides what plugins' effects override others.
    <li>Untagged plugins can only add new entries to leveled lists. If such a plugin adds an entry that already exists, it will be ignored. Furthermore, even if another plugin has already marked that entry as removed, it will not be re-added.
    <li><code>Delev</code> tagged plugins can remove entries from leveled lists. Any items present in such a plugin's masters but not in the plugin itself will be removed.
    <li><code>Relev</code> tagged plugins can relevel an existing entry (ie. change its levels and/or counts in the list), and can also override previous deletions of entries from leveled lists. However, it does not prevent a later-loading <code>Delev</code> tagged plugin from then removing an entry again.
    <li><code>Delev</code> and <code>Relev</code> tagged mods simply combines the effects of the <code>Delev</code> and <code>Relev</code> Bash Tags.
    <li>In addition to the above, the leveled list patcher removes any empty sublists from leveled lists, as these would otherwise cause the leveled list to select nothing if such a sublist was picked in-game.
</ul>
<p>It's best to simply ensure that your plugins have the correct tags and leave this section on automatic. To add plugins to or remove plugins from the list, uncheck the <q>Automatic</q> checkbox, and use the <q>Add</q> or <q>Remove</q> buttons. The latter will remove the currently selected plugin.
<p>To manually override the Delev/Relev Bash Tags for a plugin, right-click it in the section list and check or uncheck the relevant options as desired. To return to the automatic setting, select the <q>Auto</q> option in the right-click menu.


<h2 id="saves">Saves Tab</h2>
<figure>
<img src="../bash/images/readme/saves.png" alt="Saves Tab"/>
<figcaption>Wrye Bash's Saves tab.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3 id="saves-overview">Overview</h3>
<p>The Saves tab allows you to manage many aspects related to your game's saves. Save files are found in the <code>My Games\[Game]\Saves</code> directory and have the file extension <code>.ess</code>. When you quicksave or autosave, the game backs up the previous quick/autosave by replacing the file extension with <code>.bak</code>. This backup may be restored by restoring its original file extension.
<p>If you have Pluggy and/or the game's Script Extender installed, each of your save files will have a corresponding <q>cosave</q> containing the Pluggy/OBSE/SKSE-specific data. These cosaves have file extensions <code>.pluggy</code>, <code>.obse</code>, <code>.skse</code> for Pluggy, OBSE and SKSE respectively.
<p>The Saves tab is divided into two sections: the main panel lists your save files and displays some of their details in its columns. The Save Details panel on the right displays some more information relating to the currently selected save file. It comprises of the following sections:
<table>
    <thead><tr><th>Section<th>Description
    <tbody>
        <tr><td>File Name<td>This is the filename of the save. Changing it here will rename the save file.
        <tr><td>Player Info<td>These three lines give the player character's name, their level, days have passed in-game, hours played and current location.
        <tr><td>O/P Flags<td> These two flags appear to the right of the player info, and indicate the presence of cosave files: O is for OBSE cosaves, and P is for Pluggy cosaves.
        <tr><td>Screenshot<td>The screenshot embedded in the save file, taken at the moment of saving.
        <tr><td>Masters List<td>The Masters list show the plugins (.esm or .esp) that the currently selected save file depends on, the load order
        (Mod Index) of that master in the save file, and the current load order of the master plugin if present and active.<br /><br />
        Masters in the list can be renamed if the corresponding plugin has been renamed. To rename a master, first allow editing from the
        masters list column context menu and then either left-click it and edit it in the column display, or right-click it and select <q>Change To...</q> to select the desired
        replacement plugin from the Data directory. Note that you should only do this if the new name is a new version of the same mod.
        Replacing a mod with an unrelated mod will cause file corruption.<br />
        If editing is allowed, items that are renamed inside Bash internal dictionaries appear <b>bolded</b> - on clicking on the masterlist they
        take their renamed values and the <i>Save</i> and <i>Cancel</i> buttons are enabled. You may click on Save to save the new master list,
        or on Cancel to revert displaying the non renamed masters.<br />
        Disallowing edits will revert the list to the original and disable Save and Cancel buttons (if no other fields are edited).<br />
            <ul>
                <li>Note that currently renaming the master in the OBSE/SKSE cosave is NOT supported (except for very old OBSE versions). If the
        save has a cosave this will most probably corrupt the cosave.
                See <a href="https://github.com/wrye-bash/wrye-bash/issues/236">the related issue</a> (help wanted).
            </ul>
        Masters can also be disabled (again if editing is allowed) if they have been removed and are preventing your save from loading, as may sometimes happen,
        by right-clicking them and selecting <q>Disable</q>. Note that logical errors may still occur that prevent the removal of
        the plugin dependency, but this will let the game <i>try</i> to remove the dependency.<br />
        <tr><td>MI<td>Master Index of the save game. This means the actual number of the masters in succession starting with 00 Skyrim.esm, or 00 Oblivion.esm.<br />
        <tr><td>Current LO<td>Current load order in relation to the load order of the Active Plugins. Active Plugins should correspond with plugins.txt.
        <tr><td>Notes<td>This section can be used to keep notes on the save file.
</table>

<h3 id="saves-profiles">Save Profiles</h3>
<p>Save profiles are like player accounts, in that they consist of a load order plus a set of save files. They can be used to allow safe and easy switching between different characters than may use different combinations of mods, or between different stages of the same character's life (where different mods have been used in each stage). They can also associate different versions of Oblivion.esm with different save profiles, using <a href="#tools-swapping">Oblivion.esm Swapping</a>.
<p>To create or modify save profiles, use the <a href="#savesEditProfiles">Edit Profiles...</a> command in the <q>Profile</q> submenu of the column header context menu. You can create a new save profile using <q>Add</q>, delete the selected existing save profile using <q>Remove</q> and rename the selected save profile using <q>Rename</q>. The central text field can be used to store notes on the selected save profile.
<p>To select a save profile, select it from the list visible in the <q>Profile</q> submenu of the column header context menu.
<p>To assign save files to a save profile, use the <a href="#savesMoveTo">Move To</a> or <a href="#savesCopyTo">Copy To</a> submenus in the save file context menu. This will also assign any related cosave files.


<h3 id="saves-face">Face Import</h3>
<figure>
<img src="../bash/images/readme/wryebash_03.png" alt="Face Import from Esp"/>
<figcaption>Wrye Bash's Face Import dialog.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Faces may be imported from saves to saves or plugins, or from plugins to saves. This allows you to preserve a character's appearance should you wish to restart a character, to roleplay as a particular character, or to turn your character into an NPC that may be encountered during playing, among other uses.
<p>To import a face to a save:
<ol>
    <li>Select the <a href="#savesImportFace">Import Face...</a> command in a save file's context menu.
    <li>Choose the source save or plugin in the file dialogue that is displayed.
    <li>Choose the actor whose face you want to import. Click on a face in the list to display its details. If an image is associated with the face, it will be displayed.
    <ul>
        <li>If you chose a source plugin, the plugin's NPCs will be listed.
        <li>If you chose a source save, the player character will be at the top of the list, possibly followed by some clones of the player that the game uses for various purposes and some other NPCs.
    </ul>
    <li>Use the checkboxes to select additional characteristics to import.
    <ul>
        <li><b>The Race Import is incomplete.</b> It will change the physical appearance and identification of the character, but not the racial powers.
        <li><b>Use the Stats Import with care.</b> In-game stats are a combination of base stats, magical modifiers and scripted modifications. This command only affects the base stats. As such, the in-game effect may be negative or bizarrely high. In addition, such alteration of stats often confuses releveling mods, and such a mod may require temporary removal so that stats are imported to a save which does not have it active. Such mods can be reinstalled once the stats have been imported.
    </ul>
    <li>Click the <q>Import</q> button to finish.
</ol>
<p>To import a face to a plugin:
<ol>
    <li>Create a new plugin using the <a href="#modsNewMod">New Mod</a> command from the <q>File</q> menu of the plugin context menu in the Mods tab.
    <li>Right-click the new plugin and select <a href="#modsImportFace">Import Face...</a>.
    <li>Choose the source save in the file dialogue that is displayed.
</ol>
<p>Some notes on the usage of Face Import:
<ul>
    <li>Face Import does not check for unique Editor IDs. The Construction Set will inform you of any duplicates and auto-rename them, though you will probably want to rename them manually as DUPLICATE0000 is not very informative.
    <li>If you want to associate an image with a face, save the image to <code>Data\Docs\Images\[EditorID].jpg</code>, where [EditorID] is the Editor ID of the face. The size of the image box is 250x210 pixels. Wrye Bash will scale down any image supplied to fit the box.
    <li>To tweak the stats of an existing character, try importing them to a plugin, editing them there and then importing the character back into your save file.
    <li>Normally when importing a face to a plugin, only eyes and hair from Oblivion.esm or the destination plugin will be imported. However, the following steps can be used to import eyes and hairs that come from other mods.
    <ul>
        <li>Convert the source cosmetic ESP to an ESM, using the <a href="#modsCopyToEsm">Copy to Esm</a> command in the plugin context menu in the Mods tab.

            another extension will make the rename fail)

            will be renumbered to the given number and the others will be numbered in increments of one from the given number. The save name

        <tr><td colspan="2" id="savesLoadMasters">Load Masters<td>Synchronizes activated plugins to savegame's masters.
        <tr><td colspan="2" id="savesListMasters">List Masters...<td>Lists savegame masters in load order and copies the list to the clipboard. Version numbers are displayed if detected.
        <tr><td colspan="2" id="savesDiffMasters">Diff Masters...<td>If two savegames are selected, then this will compare the masters of the new save to those of the older save. If one savegame is selected, then this will compare the currently active plugins to the masters of the selected savegame. The comparison details masters that have been removed and added in the newer save since the older save, or removed and added in the load order since the selected save.
        <tr><td colspan="2" id="savesStatistics">Statistics<td><i>Oblivion only.</i> This produces a set of various technical statistics for the selected savegame. The following information is produced:
            <ul>
                <li>Array sizes. These arrays are for each of the major sections in the save file.
                <li>Created items. These are items created in-game, through scripting or some sort of crafting skill (eg. alchemy, spellmaking).
                <li>Form IDs. This is a breakdown of the Form ID table in the savegame, sorted by source plugin. The Form ID table maps savegame reference numbers to the Form ID of the referenced record. If a reference is made to a record from a mod that is no longer loaded, the Form ID is replaced with a 0.
                <li>Record details. This gives a breakdown of the different types of records stored in the save file. The type is given as a number and as text (eg. <code>48 Cell</code>), and then the number of records referenced from each plugin is given below.
                <li>New ObjectRef Bases. These are objects that belong to the savegame, for example arrows dropped on the ground in-game. They generally are created and destroyed by the game as required, though bad scripting techniques can cause some of them to stick around. The "Base" of an objectRef is the baseid of the object (e.g., the formid of a steel arrow from Oblivion.esm). The objectRef refers to these indirectly through an "iref". Usually this will map back to a formid, but if the original mod has been removed from the load order, then the formid is set to zero. If this has happened, then a count of such "Null Bases" will be shown. After the "Null Base" count (if present) is a list of New ObjectRef Bases where the count is over 100 (e.g., if there are over 100 new arrows lying around). Show is the count, the iref and the base formid. Formid beginning with FF is reference to an object defined by the savegame. Otherwise, the formid will map back to a mod. The first two digits are the modindex, and can be matched to a mod through the "MI" column in the list of savegame masters.
            </ul>

This command may be used to set all created potions to have a specific weight. Potions created after the use of this command with new names, new effects or new durations will not be affected.
        <tr><td colspan="2" id="savesUpdateNPCLevels">Update NPC Levels...<td><i>Oblivion only.</i> Updates the level information for NPCs stored in the selected savegame to reflect the active load order's NPC level settings. This is required because although NPC levels are set via plugins, once an NPC is encountered its level is stored in the save file, which overrides the plugin levels.
        <tr><td colspan="2">Export Screenshot...<td>Allows you to save the image used as the save file's screenshot as a JPEG.
        <tr><td colspan="2" id="savesRemoveBloat">Remove Bloat...<td><i>Oblivion only.</i> <b>This is an experimental command. It is recommended that saves are backed up before using it on them.</b> It attempts to determine how much bloating there is in the selected save file and then optionally remove it. If the command reports a large number of created objects, there could be a problem with one of your mods, and such mods should be removed or updated. There are two common types of bloat:
            <ul>
                <li>Excess created objects can occur through the use of scripting by a mod to duplicate existing objects in-game and a failure by the mod to clean up the duplicates after their use.
                <li>Null references are caused when objects from a mod that is removed are present in the game world. These objects then get replaced with null references when the game is next saved with the mod missing.
            </ul>
        <tr><td colspan="2" id="savesRepairAbomb">Repair Abomb<td><i>Oblivion only.</i> <q>Abomb Animation Slowing</q> is a slowing of animations that typically occurs around 225 hours into the game, though it may occur earlier or later. This is an engine bug, and this command avoids its effects by resetting a related counter (TesClass Abomb counter is reset to 0x41000000).
        <tr><td colspan="2">Repair Hair<td><i>Oblivion only.</i> Oblivion has a bug that will cause a crash if your PC's hair comes from a mod that has been removed and you then run showRaceMenu. This command resets your hair to the default for that race and gender, so you can then use showRaceMenu to select a new hair again if you wish.

<h2 id="screenshots">Screenshots Tab</h2>

<figcaption style="padding-top:655px;">Wrye Bash's Screenshots tab.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="screenshots-overview">Overview</h3>
<p>The Screenshots tab allows you to preview any screenshots taken in-game using the built-in Print Screen functionality. These screenshots are saved as bitmap files (.bmp). Selecting a screenshot from the list on the left will display it on the right. Screenshots can be converted from bitmaps into a few other formats using context menu commands.

<h3 id="screenshots-alt-path">Change screenshots directory (Oblivion)</h3>
<p>By default, Oblivion stores its screenshots in Oblivion's root folder but allows you to change the default directory via an ini setting.
    You can change the ini setting by directly editing Oblivion.ini or by using the "Next Shot" column menu item in the Screenshots tab.
    For instance Oblivion Reloaded uses Oblivion\Screenshots. To change the screenshots directory to Oblivion\Screenshots by editing the
    Oblivion.ini find the following line under the <code>[Display]</code> heading:</p>

    <code>SScreenShotBaseName=ScreenShot</code>

<p>and add the path to the Oblivion\Screenshots folder, i.e.:</p>

    <code>SScreenShotBaseName=C:\Bethesda Softworks\Oblivion\ScreenShots\Screenshot</code>

<p>Alternatively hit "Next Shot" and supply the path as in:</p>

    <code>C:\Bethesda Softworks\Oblivion\ScreenShots\Screenshot0</code>

<p>where 0 is the (optional) Screenshot base number (it will set the <code>iScreenShotIndex</code> ini setting). A relative path will
    also work (as in <code>Screenshots\Screenshot</code>). Bash will go ahead and edit the ini for you. You may also create an ini
    tweak to readily switch directories.

<p><b>IMPORTANT</b>: The base filename "Screenshot" (or any other base name you like) must be included in the path or Oblivion's
    native screenshots will not work - that is pressing the Prt Scr key will do nothing.

            will also abort the rename.

<figcaption style="padding-top:95px;">The Hide option in the right-click menu for launchers.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You can hide specific launcher icons, preventing them from being displayed, by right-clicking them and selecting <q>Hide...</q> or by inserting a semicolon before their path in the <q>bash.ini</q>.
<ul><li>For example, <code>sPhotoshopPath=;C:\Program Files\Adobe\Photoshop 7.0\Photoshop.exe</code>.</ul>
<p>You can hide some of the toggle buttons using the <code>bShowTes4...</code> options in the <code>Tool Options</code> in the <q>bash.ini</q>.
<p>You can unhide launchers hidden through the right-click option using the Settings menu. See the <a href="#tools-settings">Settings Menu</a> for more information.


<h3 id="launchers-custom">Custom Launchers</h3>
<p>Custom launcher buttons may be added by putting a shortcut to the application you wish to have a launcher for in the <code>Mopy\Apps</code> directory. Wrye Bash will then use the following information from the shortcut:
<ul>
    <li>Icon
    <li>Working directory
    <li>Command line arguments
    <li>Comments
</ul>
<p>If you want to have a custom icon for a launcher, place a PNG image with the same name as the shortcut, appending the icon size, in the same folder. For example:
<ul>
    <li>Notepadpp.lnk
    <li>Notepadpp24.png
</ul>
<p><b>Note:</b> 24x24 icons taken from shortcuts do not work well, so if you are using this size, be sure to include a custom icon. Icon size displayed can be adjusted in the <q>bash.ini</q> or the <a href="#tools-settings">Settings</a> menu.

<h3 id="people-overview">Overview</h3>
<p>The People tab functions as a simple database that can be used to keep notes on various people (eg. why you blocked a forum user, or what a good mod someone made).
<p>People are listed in the column on the left, and the large text box on the right can be used for writing notes on the selected person. Notes are saved automatically as you type them, but otherwise the text box behaves as a simple text editor such as Notepad.
<p>The Karma column displays the karma level you have set for them. Karma is a simple way of rating your disposition towards a person. The Header column displays the first 75 characters of text in a person's notes. Clicking a column header will sort by that column.

<figcaption style="padding-top:520px;">Wrye Bash's Doc Browser.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The Doc Browser allows you to quickly and easily scan through your mods' documentation. The supported document types are: text files, HTML files and MHT files (HTML archives). To display the Doc Browser, double click any plugin in the main list of the Mods tab.
<p>When you double-click a plugin, Wrye Bash will open the Doc Browser and attempt to determine which document to associate with it. If it can determine one, it will display it. Otherwise, a blank page will be displayed. To associate a document with a plugin, use the <q>Set Doc...</q> button in the Doc Browser. To disassociate a document with a plugin, use the <q>Forget Doc...</q> button in the Doc Browser.
<p>You can also rename an associated document using the <q>Rename Doc...</q> button to select a new name and/or location. The document will be renamed and/or moved to this location.
<p>You can edit a document by clicking the <q>Edit Doc...</q> button. The document can then be edited in the viewing window. To finish editing, click the <q>Edit Doc...</q> button again. Changes are automatically saved when you select a new plugin, close the Doc Browser or finish editing.
<p>A document can be opened in its default external editor by clicking the <q>Open Doc...</q> button.
<p>A new document can be created for a plugin by clicking the <q>Set Doc...</q> button and choosing a new filename. This creates a document using a blank template that you can then edit. The default template is <code>Data\Docs\My Readme Template</code> if it exists, or if not, <code>Data\Docs\Bash Readme Template.txt</code>. The latter is written in Wrye wiki text format, which will be displayed as HTML when the Doc Browser is not in edit mode.
<p>To view a different document, select a different plugin in the list on the left of the Doc Browser or in the Mods tab.
<p>Some notes on Doc Browser behaviour:
<ul>
    <li>If a plugin is renamed in the Mods tab, then any documents associated with it will become associated to the plugin's new name.
    <li>If a plugin is copied in the Mods tab, then any documents associated with it will also become associated with the copy.
    <li>Documents can be stored in any location, though <code>Data\Docs</code> is the standard location.
    <li>If you delete a plugin, its documentation will not be deleted, but it will no longer be viewable through the Doc Browser.
    <li>If you hide a plugin, its documentation will still be viewable through the Doc Browser.
</ul>


<h3 id="tools-checker">Mod Checker</h3>
<figure>
<img src="../bash/images/readme/mod-checker-1.png" alt="Mod Checker"/>
<figcaption>Wrye Bash's Mod Checker</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The Mod Checker checks your active and merged plugins for errors, and provides warnings for any found, as well as configuration recaps and suggestions. It can be opened by clicking the <a href="Wrye%20Bash%20General%20Readme.html#launchersModChecker">Mod Checker button</a> in the status bar.
<p>At the top of the report is the Active Mod Files section, which lists your load order. It also displays any warnings that are applicable beneath the plugin(s) that they are applicable to. These warnings are either regarding missing masters or delinquent masters.
<ul>
    <li>Missing masters occur when a plugin that an active plugin depends on is not active. This results in an immediate CTD when the game is launched.
    <li>Delinquent masters occur when a plugin's master loads after the plugin itself. This should be fixed to prevent issues in-game.
</ul>
<p>The next section of the report details the output of any rulesets installed. These are text files that contain a set of instructions that tell the Mod Checker what to look for and what to say in the report if anything is found. Currently the only ruleset distributed by Wrye Bash is for Cobl. Rulesets are stored in <code>Data\Bash Patches</code> and end in <q>Rules.txt</q>. Information on ruleset syntax can be found at <a href="http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Tes4Mod:Wrye_Bash/Mod_Checker">UESP: Wrye Bash Mod Checker</a>.
<p>The rest of the report details any plugin groups that have been set up. Each group's section contains the following information:
<ul>
    <li>Notes: These are various notes on the plugin group, as entered by the user.
    <li>Configuration: This is a summary of the plugin group's configuration. It uses a few symbols to denote the status of plugins, these are: x: active; +: merged; *: imported; -: inactive/unmerged.
    <li>Suggestions: Specific suggestions for the plugin group. These are typically activating or deactivating certain plugins, or replacing mods with other mods.
    <li>Warnings: Like suggestions, but the causes are more likely to cause issues. This section will detail what should be activated or deactivated to resolve the problems.
</ul>

<h3 id="tools-swapping">Oblivion.esm Swapping</h3>
<p>Oblivion.esm swapping is a feature that allows mod authors to switch between different versions of Oblivion.esm on the fly. This is useful as it allows mod authors to make plugins that are totally SI-independent (as the Shivering Isles patches Oblivion.esm instead of using a new plugin). It can also be used to avoid the need for a fully patched Oblivion to run a plugin, but this usage is <b>not recommended</b>. If you want a plugin to work on older versions of Oblivion, use the <a href="#modsVersion0.8">Version 0.8</a> command on it.
<p>The main requirement for swapping to work is that you have the necessary copies of the different Oblivion.esm files. <b>This is only possible if you copy and rename Oblivion.esm before installing Shivering Isles.</b> There are three accepted versions of Oblivion.esm in addition to the latest SI one. These are determined by their file size:
<ul>
    <li>247388848 bytes: this is the 1.1 version. Rename it to <code>Oblivion_1.1.esm</code>.
    <li>247388812 bytes: this is the GOTY version without SI. Rename it to <code>Oblivion_GOTY non-SI.esm</code>.
    <li>247388894 bytes: this is an uncommon variant of the 1.1 version. Rename it to <code>Oblivion_1.1b.esm</code>.
</ul>
<p>You can then swap between the different versions of Oblivion.esm using the <a href="#modsOblivion.esm">Oblivion.esm</a> submenu in the Mods tab column header context menu. Your currently active version will be checked, select another to swap them. You can also perform the same swapping in the Saves tab column header context menu, but in addition to the swapping this will also mark the selected version as the preferred version to use with the current <a href="#saves-profiles">Save Profile</a>. If you then switch to another save profile and back to this one, Oblivion.esm will be swapped automatically.
<p>Wrye Bash displays the current version of Oblivion.esm in its version indicators. The main indicator is in the title bar of the main Wrye Bash window, but there are also indicators placed after Oblivion.esm in the Mods tab plugin list, and after Oblivion.esm in the Masters tab for plugins and savegames. The three possible indicators are:
<ul>
    <li>[1.1]: You are currently using the 1.1 or 1.1b version of Oblivion.esm.
    <li>[GOTY non-SI]: You are currently using the GOTY without SI installed version of Oblivion.esm.
    <li>[SI]: You are currently using the Shivering Isles-patched version of Oblivion.esm.
</ul>

<h2 id="international">Internationalisation</h2>
<h3 id="international-overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Wrye Bash has built-in support for translation into other languages, using text files that tell it which English strings in the source code should be translated, and into what. These text files are found in <code>Mopy\bash\l10n\</code>. New translations or updates to existing translations should be presented to the Wrye Bash team so that they may be included in future releases.
<p>To begin translating, or to update an existing translation, use the following steps.
<ol>
    <li>Select <a href="#settingsDumpTranslator">Dump Translator</a> from Wrye Bash's Settings menu. This generates a new version of the translation file for your locale. The new file will be named appropriately, except from the leading "NEW", and will contain any translations already done.
    <li>Delete any existing translation text file for the same language.
    <li>Rename the new translator file, removing the leading "NEW". Do not change the rest of the filename.
    <li>Edit the translator file, adding translations or editing existing translations.
    <li>To test a translator file, save your changes then restart Wrye Bash, and select the language from the <a href="#settingsLanguage">Language</a> submenu in Wrye Bash's Settings menu.
</ol>


<h3 id="international-format">Translator File Format</h3>
<p>Below is an excerpt from a translator file.
<code class="box">=== basher.py, 3711
Active profile cannot be removed.
>>>>

=== basher.py, 3717
Delete profile %s and the %d save files it contains?
>>>>
DELETE PROFILE %s AND THE %d SAVE FILES IT CONTAINS?
</code>
<p>The above contains two separate translation entries. Each entry begins with the source code file and line number the string to be translated is found on.
<p>The file line is followed by the original text string on a new line, which is then followed by a line containing only <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>. The translation entry ends with a final line containing the translated text string.
<p><b>Note:</b> It is important that the formatting characters are not removed or moved or added to. Formatting characters are those that start with a percentage sign or a backslash, eg. <code> %s %d %08X \n</code>. If a formatting character is missing, Wrye Bash will throw an exception, which is bad.
