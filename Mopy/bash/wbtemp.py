"""Encapsulates Wrye Bash's temporary dir/files handling, including early boot
and the global .wbtemp directory.

Generally, you want to use TempDir or TempFile in a context handler. That way
you guarantee that the temporary files will get cleaned up, no matter how
complicated your flow of logic might get or even if an exception occurs.

If you need more control, use new_temp_dir and new_temp_file to create
temporary directories and files and clean them up manually with
cleanup_temp_dir and cleanup_temp_file.

If worst comes to worst, Wrye Bash's atexit hook should clean up all leftover
temp files when Wrye Bash closes. Sometimes this is unavoidable (see e.g.
Path.start()), but it's almost always better to be explicit and clean up your
temporary directories and files, if only to respect the user's disk usage."""
