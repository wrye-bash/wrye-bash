"""This module implements an event propagation framework on top of wx's
framework. The point here is that doing this allows us to build in some
convenience features to save a lot of code.

Note: You probably want to read this docstring in the actual file instead of in
the PyCharm popup, some parts break in the popup.

There are four main differences between this system and wx's:
  1. This one is mostly just syntax: We call 'callbacks' 'listeners',
     'binding' is 'subscribing' and 'triggering' an event is 'posting' an
     event. The reason for this change in terminology is to visually distance
     the code from wx, even just at a glance.
  2. Instead of passing wx's event classes directly to listeners, we apply
     'processors' to them beforehand. A good example is the text processor
     used for _ATextInput.on_text_changed. When a EVT_TEXT (i.e. text changed)
     event is triggered by wx, this processor is used to send the new text
     instead of the event itself to subscribers.
  3. We deviate from wx's default event behavior by always continuing to
     process listeners unless we are explicitly asked not to. In wx, this is
     the other way around - event.Skip() has to be called, unless you want to
     swallow the event (which is rarely wanted and can easily lead to bugs).
     Nearly all of WB's need for wx event objects was just to call
     event.Skip().
  4. Multiple listeners can subscribe to one event. wx allows just one binding,
     and attempting to bind a new callback will remove the old binding.

Subscribing:
  To subscribe to an event, simply call subscribe() on the EventHandler
  instance provided by the GUI component you're using. For example:
    >>> parent = None
    >>> def on_text(new_text: str):
    >>>     ... # do something with new_text here
    >>> from Mopy.bash.gui import TextArea
    >>> txt_area = TextArea(parent)
    >>> txt_area.on_text_changed.subscribe(on_text)
  Now, whenever the text changes in txt_area changes, on_text will get called
  with the new text. GUI components will always provide their event handlers
  with names following that scheme (on_something_happened). See also the next
  section.

Creating Event Handlers:
  If you're designing or modifying a GUI component and want to provide an event
  handler, you'll have to make a few decisions. This section will walk through
  an example for implementing a event handler for the EVT_SIZE event (triggered
  when a component is resized).
    1. Create the event handler inside your __init__. As mentioned above, the
       name should always follow the on_something_happened scheme, for
       consistency in the codebase and to make using event handlers easier:
         from gui import EventHandler
         # ...
         self.on_resized = self._evt_handler(_wx.EVT_SIZE)
    2. Decide what processor is needed. By default, null_processor is used,
       which will simply discard the event object. In this case, we can come up
       with a useful processor:
         def size_processor(event):
             return [event.width, event.height]
       This processor will transform the event into two integers. A matching
       listener might look like this:
         def on_author_field_resized(new_width, new_height):
             # rescale some components, wrap text, etc.
       Note that processors must always return a list. The list is then
       unpacked via Python's * operator and fed to the listeners.
    3. Pass the processor to the event handler (in your __init__):
         self.on_resized = self._evt_handler(_wx.EVT_SIZE, size_processor)
    4. You should place some documentation in the docstring of your GUI
       component's class indicating what events it offers and with what
       signatures to subscribe to them (note that I'm using # here, but these
       should be part of the docstring of your class):
         # Events:
         #  - on_resized(new_weight: int, new_height: int): Posted when this
         #    component is resized. ...
       Following the format indicated above is highly recommended for all GUI
       components.

Return Values:
  All listeners defined above have returned nothing. However, listeners may
  return one of three values defined in gui.events.EventResult. If nothing is
  returned, then EventHandler interprets this as the same as returning
  EventResult.CONTINUE, meaning that the event will simply be propagated to the
  next listener, if one exists. The three values are:
    1. EventResult.CONTINUE: Same as no return value. See above.
    2. EventResult.FINISH: Indicates that the event was successfully handled,
       but that it shouldn't be propagated to the next listener, if one exists.
    3. EventResult.CANCEL: Indicates that the event should not be allowed to
       execute. Only events that explicitly mention it in their documentation
       can be canceled, all others will raise a RuntimeError instead."""
