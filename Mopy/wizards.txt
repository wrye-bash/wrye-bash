= Introduction

Starting with Wrye Bash version 278, wizards were added to make it easier to install BAIN packages.  Wizards allow modders to include a simple configuration script with their packages.  All that needs to be done is create a script file name __wizard.txt__ and include it in the package.  When run, the wizard will step through a series of dialogs to determine which sub-packages, esps, and esms should be selected.  Afterwards, you can install the package using those selections.

== Dialogs
=== SelectOne
This [[images/SelectOne.jpg|dialog]] gives you a list of options, with the option to select one of them.  Each option can display an image associated with it, and a description as well.  To see a larger version of the image displayed, either right click or middle click on the image.  The wizard can specify a default answer, and if you are running it as an Auto-Wizard, then this page will be skipped, using the default option.

=== SelectMany
This [[images/SelectMany.jpg|dialog]] gives you a list of options, with the option to select one or more of them, or even none of them.  Each option can display an image associated with it, and a description as well.  To see a larger version of the image displayed, either right click or middle click on the image.  The wizard can specify default options, and if you are running it as an Auto-Wizard, then this page will be skipped, using the default options.

=== Versions
This [[images/Versions.jpg|dialog]] will show up if the wizard specified minimum version requirements, and your system doesn't meet those requirements.  If you want to run the wizard anyway, you can override the warning by clicking the "Install Anyway." option.  If you are running the wizard as an Auto-Wizard, this page will still be shown, but the "Install Anyway." option will already be checked for you.

=== Cancel
This [[images/Cancel.jpg|dialog]] will be show if the wizard cancels execution for some reason.  If a reason is given, it will be displayed

=== Error
This [[images/Error.jpg|dialog]] will be shown if the wizard encounters an error in the wizard file.  The wizard will then quit.

=== Finish
This [[images/Finish.jpg|dialog]] will be shown at the end of the wizard, to show you which sub-packages, esps, and esms will be selected.  It is also a place for any extra notes from the mod auther to be displayed.

== The language
BAIN wizards use a language similar to OBMM script, so modders familiar with OBMM should be able to quickly write BAIN versions of their scripts.

Wizards are case sensitive, so ensure you get the case right.  The only exception to this is filenames.

Each line of the wizard contains one statement.  If you want to continue the line onto the next one, just add a __backslash ( \ )__ to the end of the line.  This will cause BAIN to read the next line as is it were part of the first.

=== Variables
You can use variables by assigning a value using an [[#Operators|assignment operator]].  Just make sure you assign a value before using a variable, or it will generate an error.

Variable names can contain any alpha-numeric characters (a-z,A-Z,0-9) and underscores ( _ ), but cannot start with a digit.  You also cannot create a variable with the same name (case sensitive) as a [[#Keywords|keyword]], [[#Functions|function]], or [[#Constants|constant]].  Variables can be used to hold any of the following types of data:
* **Integers**
  * 3
  * -1
  * 0
* **Decimals**
  * 0.123
  * -3.5
  * 7.0
* **[[#Strings|Strings]]**
  * "Hello"
  * 'World!'

=== Constants
Constants are a sub-type of variables.  They follow the same rules, only they cannot be changed.  You cannot create constants yourself, but there are a few pre-defined constants in BAIN.

=== Expressions
BAIN will evaluate expressions following the correct order of operations.  For example the expression:

__3 + 6 * 2__

Will evaluate to __15__ as expected, not __18__.

=== Strings
Strings can be denoted by enclosing the text in either single quotes ( ' ), or double quotes ( " ).  If you need to include a special character in the string, use an escape sequence.  Strings can be added and multiplied using the addition and multiplication [[#Operators|operator]].  You can also test if one string is contained within another using the [[#Operators|in operator]].

= Functions

Functions are called just like in any other language, using the function name followed by arguments inclosed in parenthesis.  Arguments can be seperatred either by whitespace or a comma.  For example, both of the following would have the same result:

__DummyFunction(arg1, "Hello")__<br />
__DummyFunction(arg1 "Hello")__

= Operators

== Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are how you assign values to variables.  The usage can either be to assign one variable a value, or multiple variables the same value:
* variable = value
* variable1 = variable2 = variable3 = value

=== Assignment (=)
* variable = value

=== Compound Assignment (+=, -=, etc)
There are compound assignment operators for all of the math operators.  A compound assignment will first perform the math operation using the variable and the value, then assign the result to the variable.
* variable += value
* variable -= value
* variable *= value

== Math Operators

=== Addition (+)
Adds two values, variables, etc together

=== Subtraction (-)
Subtracts two values, variables, etc.

=== Multiplication (*)
Multiplies two values, variables, etc together.

=== Division (/)
Divides two values, variables, etc.

=== Exponentiation (^)
Raised one value to the power of another value
