== Wrye Bash How To's and FAQs
__After you [[#Installation|install Wrye Bash]],__ you may find yourself a bit lost in the features. The rest of this manual describes the features in depth, but if you're looking to just do one or two things quickly, then you should consult the __[[http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Tes4Mod:Wrye_Bash|Wrye Bash Help Pages]]__ at UESP.

In particular, see:
* [[http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Tes4Mod:Wrye Bash/Basic|Wrye Bash Basic Usage]] for quick "how to" guides of most common bash uses.
* [[http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Tes4Mod:Wrye Bash/Advanced|Wrye Bash Advanced FAQs]]: Overviews of using advanced Bash features.

== Quick Tour
<img src="bash/images/WryeBash_04.png" style="width: 686; height: 527; border: 0;" alt="Saves Tab"></img>

* At the top are the main tabs: [[#InstallersTab|Installers]], [[#ModsTab|Mods]], [[#INIEditsTab|INI Edits]] [[#SavesTab|Saves]] and [[#ScreenshotsTab|Screenshots]].
* The __savegame list__ is the main feature of this Saves Tab. For each file, details are shown and general "health" of the savegame is indicated by the color of the savegame's checkbox. Purple is best -- totally safe to play. Red is worst -- meaning that one of the master mods files is missing.
* The file details for the currently selected savegame are shown to the right. File name, stats and savegame preview image are all shown.
* The __masters list__ for the savegame is shown at the bottom of the details. The masters for the savegame are just the mods (esps and esms) that the savegame depends on.
* Most operations in Wrye Bash are accessed through __context menus.__ In this case, I right clicked on a savegame, and so got the savegame menu. Here I'm selecting the [[#|Reweigh Potions]] command.
* Incidentally, you'll notice that the __title of the window__ is "Wrye Bash: ELandra 4 SI [SI]". "ELandra 4 SI" is just the name of the currently selected [[#SaveProfiles|savegame profile]]. The trailing [SI] indicates that I'm using the [[#OblivionesmSwapping|Shivering Isles (SI) version]] of Oblivion.esm.
* At the bottom is the [[#LaunchButtons|launch bar]], with buttons for launching Oblivion, OBMM, TESCS and options for launching OBSE and quitting Bash when launching Oblivion.

== Installation ===============================================================
=== Get and Install
* __Download and run Wrye Python ([[http://tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=22368|TESNexus]])__
  * Install all components. It's best to accept the default settings for each installer.
  * __Note:__ This is not part of Wrye Bash itself -- rather it is a bundled installation of python and related libraries that Wrye Bash is built on top of. You should only need to install this once. For more info, see [[#|Python Components]].
* __Download and Unzip ([[http://tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=22368|Wrye Bash XXX.zip]]) or Install ([[http://tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=22368|Wrye Bash XXX.exe]])__
  * For the manual archive instalation, unzip the files ~~into your Oblivion installation directory.~~ If you've done this correctly, you'll find Wrye Bash Launcher.pyw and other bash files under Oblivion\Mopy.
  * Note: This is the actual Wrye Bash code/application. It updates fairly frequently, but is small and easy to install.
* __Upgrading__
  * If you're upgrading from an older version of Wrye bash, then just get the latest Wrye Bash XXX.zip or Wrye Bash XXX.exe file from TesNexus and install it. There's no need to remove anything or reinstall any python components.
* __Advanced:__
  * You can place the "\Mopy\" folders outside of the Oblivion directory, but you'll need to set the [[#StartingWryeBash|OblivionPath]] option.
    * This will probably only be useful for Bash developers (latest stable release in Oblivion directory + development version outside = my life is easier).
    * May also be useful for running Bash from a flash drive (!!! WILD SPECULATION !!!).
    * Remember when upgrading to install the "Data" folder to "\Oblivion\" and the "Mopy" folder to wherever you have it now

=== Windows Vista/7
* On Windows Vista, the UAC (User Account Control) protects the Program Files directory (usually c:\Program Files) against writing by regular users. This can be a problem for Bash and other mod editing and management tools (TESCS, TES4View, OBMM).
* **Best Solution:** Install Oblivion to somewhere other than under the Program Files directory. (E.g., install to c:\Games\Oblivion). Such an alternate directory is not subject to UAC control and won't have the same access and virtualization problems that the default install will have.
* **Alternate Solutions:** Alternatively, you might always run as admin, or turn off UAC -- but both of those approaches are ill-advised. For more advice, see the [[http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Tes4Mod:Wrye_Bash_Help|Unofficial Help]] page at UESP.

=== Starting Wrye Bash
* **Double click** the "Wrye Bash Launcher.pyw" file.
* Launching from another location:
  * You can drag "Wrye Bash Launcher" to your Quick Launch toolbar. OR...
  * In Explorer, copy "Wrye Bash Launcher", then go to the other location and use "Paste Shortcut".
* Advanced: You can place the "\Mopy\" folders outside of the Oblivion directory, but you'll need to set the OblivionPath through "bash.ini" or the -o argument.
  * bash.ini:
    * See "bash_default.ini" for full instructions - look for __sOblivionPath__ under __General__.
  * -o Argument:
    * __Type:__ <code>"Wrye Bash Launcher.pyw" -o "C:\\Games\\Oblivion\\"</code>
    * Note that Python treats the back-slash <code>\</code> as an escape character... even from the command prompt.

=== [color=red]If Bash Won't Start[/color]
* **If Bash refuses to start, or quits after quickly flashing up a window...**
  * Most likely there is a problem with your setup. Alternatively there may be a bug with Bash.
  * You can usually figure out the problem by getting the **bug dump** and reviewing it. And if you can't puzzle it out, someone on the Elder Scrolls forums may be able to help.
* __Finding the Bugdump__
  * Sometimes the error will be written to a file in the Mopy directory called __bash.log__. If that file is there, then that's the bug dump. You can open it with any text editor.
  * If it's not present, then you'll have to generate the bug dump yourself...
* __Generating the Bugdump__
  * Open a command shell (Start: Programs: Accessories: Command Prompt).
  * __chdir__ to the Mopy directory. "chdir" means "change directory". E.g.: <code>chdir /D "C:\Program Files\Bethesda Softworks\Oblivion\Mopy"</code>
  * __Type:__ <code>"Wrye Bash Debug.py" -d</code>
    * This requires that the file associations for .pyw files is set in windows.  If it is not, you can try the old way:
    . <code>"C:\python27\python.exe" "Wrye Bash Debug.py" -d</code>
    . Note that this is assuming you have installed Python 2.7 to the default directory.  Make sure you use the correct path to python.exe
  * Doing this will cause any error messages that Bash generates on start to spew to the command shell. This is the bugdump.
  * If there is too much text printed to the console, you can direct it to a text file like this:
  . <code>"Wrye Bash Debug.py" -d > bugdump.txt</code>
* __Dealing with Bugdump__
  * First, **look at it!** -- especially the last several lines -- this will often give you a good clue as to what the problem is, and you may be able to resolve it on your own.
  * Second, see following section for common problems and their solution.

=== Common Problems
* __Can't find bash.py__
  * Make sure that you chdir to the Mopy directory first.
* __Can't Find User Directory__
  * The problem here is that python is not very good at getting the user directories. There are two options here.
  * This used to be semi-common problem but should not be an issue for users who have pywin32 installed. (PyWin32 is included in the Wrye Python installer.)
* __Can't Find wxversion__
  * I don't understand the source of the problem, but it has something to do with the way python is installed. The solution seems to be to reinstall python and wxpython in that order. (You may have to first uninstall both of them.)
* __no module named wx__
  * You haven't installed wxPython or you haven't installed it in the right place.
  * Be sure that you actually installed (not just downloaded) wxPython.
  * If, when installing wxPython, you did not see the usual installation wizard dialog, then you almost certainly downloaded a corrupted version of wxPython. Re-download it. Make sure that the downloaded file is larger than a few kB (actually, it should be about 8 Mb).
* __The NTVDM CPU has encountered an illegal instruction.__
  * If an error message like this pops up (very rare) the problem is with your OS installation. For some reason the Microsoft utility that handles the installation of installer files is messed up. As far as I know, the only solution is to fix (maybe reinstall) your OS (the utility is part of the Windows OS).
* __Generating comtypes__
  * The very first time you run Bash after installing ComTypes, you may get a popup with six lines similar to: <code># Generating comtypes.gen.stdole</code>
  * Close the popup and ignore it. It shouldn't appear again unless you reinstall ComTypes.
* __UNCommon Problems__
  * If the problem is not listed above and thinking about it doesn't help, then go to the forums and post the whole bugdump. Preferably, you should post the dump in the **Relz/Help** topic (see [[#WryeBash|Discussion]] link at top of page) or you can start a new topic. Be sure to mention "Wrye Bash" in the text of the post.
  * **Hint:** Control-C does not work in the command line window, but you can still copy text from it by:
    * Right click and select "Select All" to selecting the text,
    * Hitting the __Enter__ key.

=== Python Components
* If you're having difficulty getting or installing Wrye Python or if you prefer to do things by hand, then here's some additional info on the python components it installs.
* If uninstalling old Python and Python addon versions (recommended) make sure to uninstall all of them starting with the addons via the control panel->Add/Remove Programs or Programs &amp; Features.
* __Components:__
  * __Python 2.7__
    * This is the main install for [[http://www.python.org/|Python]]. It provides the base interpreter/compiler and the basic libraries.
    * Download link: __Python [ [[http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.2/python-2.7.2.msi|Python 2.7.2]] ]__
  * __wxPython 2.8.12.0 ANSI__
    * Python supports several different GUI libraries. Wrye Bash uses [[http://www.wxpython.org/|wxPython]].
    * Download link: __[ [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/wxpython/files/wxPython/2.8.12.0/wxPython2.8-win32-ansi-2.8.12.0-py27.exe|wxPython 2.8.12.0 ansi for Python 2.7]] ]__
  * __PyWin32__
    * Optional component.  PyWin32 provides access to windows registry info on user folders, etc. Wrye Bash uses this to retrieve version info for BAIN Wizards, so it is required for Wizards to function.
    * Download link: __[ [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/Build216/pywin32-216.win32-py2.7.exe/download|PyWin32 216 for Python 2.7]] ]__
  * __ComTypes 0.6.2__
    * Optional component (for the PM Archives Tab).  If [[http://starship.python.net/crew/theller/comtypes/|ComTypes]] is not installed, the PM Archives tab will not be visible.
    * Download link:  __[ [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/comtypes/files/comtypes/0.6.2/comtypes-0.6.2.win32.exe/download|comtypes 0.6.2 for Python (all versions)]] ]__
* __Alternate Python Installations__
  * Alternate python installations ~~might~~ work, however no guarantee is made. Currently (and for the foreseeable future), Python 2.7, wxPython 2.8.12.0, etc. are the preferred versions.


== Help! ======================================================================
* __Startup Problems:__ See [[#|If Bash Won't Start]].
* __Windows Are Off Screen:__
  * This may happen if you reduce your screen size or remove a second screen. Symptoms are that window shows up in taskbar, but doesn't appear. Also, you can use the taskbar to maximize the window, but once minimized it disappears again.
  * As of v190, Bash's main window should autocorrect to be displayed when you start Bash.
  * For other windows, see [[http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows/bring-misplaced-off-screen-windows-back-to-your-desktop-keyboard-trick/|this tip]].
* __Other Tips/Help:__
  * First, Read this readme! Helps to use the search feature of your browser.
  * Second, visit [[http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Tes4Mod:Wrye_Bash|How To's and FAQs]].

== Backing Up =================================================================
If you are looking to back up your Bash installation, Bash stores files in a variety of locations.

* The easiest method is to just run the Backup/Restore Settings commands, which are available in the main Bash menu. These commands do not backup/restore any mod files or saves, just the Wrye Bash settings/data.

__Overview:__
  * "Oblivion\Mopy"
    * Contains Bash itself.
    * Does not need to be backed up since you can simply reinstall Bash.
    * If you are working on any localization files, you may want to back them up, though: Oblivion\Mopy\bash\l10n
  * "Oblivion\Data\Bash Patches"
    * Contains various csv files used by the export/import functions.
    * Only needs backing up if you've exported any csv files that you want to keep.
  * "Oblivion\Data\Docs"
    * Contains all the documents from mods installed by BAIN.
    * Does not typically need to be backed up since you can anneal any packages to reinstall their readmes.
  * "Oblivion\Data\INI Tweaks"
    * Contains the various INI tweaks that can be applied by Bash.
    * Only needs backing up if you have custom INI tweaks you've added.
  * "Documents\My Games\Oblivion" (same place the Oblivion saves are stored)
    * Contains bash settings.
    * Important to backup.
  * "Oblivion Mods" (one directory prior to Oblivion)
    * Contains BAIN packages, and other bash settings.
    * Important to backup.


== Global Bash Keyboard Shortcuts =============================================
These keyboard commands work pretty much everywhere (as in if you want it it will almost certainly work) in Bash.

*__Listing:__
  * <code> ctrl-numpad plus (+)</code>: fits column sizes to fit what is displayable.
  * <code> ctrl-a</code>: selects all.
  * <code> shift-crtl-a</code>: deselects all.


== Launch Buttons =============================================================
At the bottom left of Bash's main window you'll find launch buttons for Oblivion and other applications (if they're installed). You'll also find one or two toggle buttons.

=== Application Buttons
* __Overview:__
  * Each of the application buttons will be present if the corresponding application is present in the Oblivion install directory or in the directory specified in the bash.ini.
  * You can also control if some of them show up or not through the bash.ini - by settings the sections for Modeling or texturing or audio tools to 0.
  * Tes4Gecko &amp; Oblivion Book Creator will be available if the javaw.exe is present in Windows\System32 and their .jar file is present in Oblivion install directory or for OBC in the data directory.
  * Tes4Edit, Tes4Trans and Tes4view are just different modes of Tes4Edit.exe and will be available if Tes4Edit.exe is available.
    * You can also control if some of the modes show up or not through the bash.ini - by setting  __bShowTes4...__ under __[Tool Options]__
  * Tip: If you don't want certain launcher icons to show up you can place a semi-colon ; in the path in the bash.ini after you set up your paths.
    * Example: sPhotoshopPath=;C:\Program Files\Adobe\Photoshop 7.0\Photoshop.exe
* __Applications:__
  * Oblivion (Main Oblivion executable, not the launcher.) 16 <img src="bash/images/oblivion16.png" width="16" height="16" style="border: 0;"  alt="tool image"></img> 32 <img src="bash/images/oblivion32.png" width="32" height="32" style="border: 0;" alt="tool image"></img>

  * __{{A:Custom buttons}}:__
    * Put any shortcut in the Mopy\Apps directory.
      * Wrye Bash will read the shortcut and get the following information from it:
        * Icon
        * Working directory
        * Command line
        * Comment
      * Note that automatic icons from the shortcut do not work well when you have specified a 24 pixel icon size in bash.ini, so be sure to specify a custom icon if you want 24x24 icons.
    * If you want a custom icon, just put a PNG with the same name as the shortcut, ending in the icon size, in the same folder.
    . For example:
      . Notepadpp.lnk
      . Notepadpp24.png  &lt;- custom 24x24 icon to use

== Installers Tab =============================================================
The Installers tab provides a mod package installer facility. In general purpose, it's much like TimeSlip's OBMM tool, however implementation is somewhat different from OBMM. Relative to OBMM, there are several substantial improvements; however in other ways, it is simpler and less powerful than OBMM. (Notably, there is no BSA archive handling in Bain.)

=== Getting Started
Here's a brief getting started guide. You may have to read sections further down before this section makes full sense.
* __Terminology: Package__
  * A "package" is a collection of esps, esms and/or resource files. Everything listed under the Installers tab is a package. Packages can be either archive files in (zip, 7z or rar format) or directories (aka Projects).
* __Terminology: [[#BainConversionFiles|Bain Conversion File]]__
  * A "Bain Conversion File" or "BCF" is a special archive that tells Bash how to convert a standard archive into a Bain-ready archive. It also contains any new files that weren't present in the original archive. BCF's allow mod users to easily share their custom Bain compilations.
* __Initialization__
  * When you first visit the Installers tab after starting Bash, Bain will need to go through an initialization process. If you've done this before, and no new packages are installed, and the machine is "warm", then it will take on the order of ten seconds.
  * However, if you have just added a bunch of packages, then Bain will take longer to initialize, since it will need to scan all new/modified packages.
  * **In particular, the first time you start Bain, it will take a long time (on the order of five to fifteen minutes) to initialize.** Enjoy your coffee break. :D
  * If Bain is disabled (which you may have done by answering 'No' on the first time visit to the Bain tab), you can re-enable it by right clicking on the column tab and choosing 'Enable'.
* __Reducing Init Times__
  * You can disable Bain entirely by unchecking "Enabled" in the column context menu on the Installers tab. (Note that this does **not** erase previously stored info. I.e. it's safe to disable Bain and then later re-enable it if you prefer.)
  * You can choose to "Avoid on Startup" (again from column context menu). This will cause Bash to try to avoid the Installers tab when it starts up. And since Bain won't initialize until you visit the Installers tab, you'll save a bit of time if you weren't planning on visiting it anyway.
* __Install Directory__
  * As noted below, Bain looks for packages in the __Oblivion Mods\Bash Installers__ directory. Easiest way to get started with Bain is to just grab all your old mod archives and move them to the Installers directory. Then return to the Installers directory to see Bain's evaluation.
  * If you're a modder with existing project directories, you can move those to the Installers directory too.
  * You can also drag and drop your project directories, Zip, RAR, 7zip, and OMOD files directly onto the BAIN window.
    * For project directories, and archives, you will be asked if you want to move or copy the files
    * For OMODs, they will be unpacked into projects.
* __Reviewing Package Status__
  * Some packages may be green, but most (even ones that you have previously installed) will likely be red. (Even if you have installed a package, Bain's [[#|Doc File Sweeping]] means that some files will be in unexpected places.
  * For each package, you can select it, and then review its details in the Debug text box. In particular, look for Missing and Overridden files.
  * You can install package as desired (though you may want to change their [[#Ordering|order]] first.)
  * For complex packages, you will likely want to configure their sub-packages before activating them.
  * For packages with unrecognized structure (grey checkbox and name), you'll need to restructure the package's directories and files to something more like what Bain expects before you can install them.

=== Overview
Bain will search for and display packages from the (new) __Oblivion Mods\Bash Installers__ directory. Mods (either archives or projects) can then be installed or uninstalled, and their status can be reviewed in the details pane on the right.
* __Checkmarks__
  * Installed packages will be marked with a "+".
* __Icon Colors__
. Icon colors indicate the degree to which the package is synchronized with the Oblivion\Data directory:
  * <img src="bash/images/checkbox_green_off.png" width="16" height="16" style="border: 0;"  alt="tool image"></img> Green: Package is fully synced. Note that a package can be green even if it is not "Active". E.g. if you have two identical packages and one is (fully) installed, then it will be green and checked. But the identical package will also be green -- since it too is fully synced with the data directory.
  * <img src="bash/images/checkbox_red_off.png" width="16" height="16" style="border: 0;"  alt="tool image"></img> Red: Some files in the package are missing from the data directory.
  * <img src="bash/images/checkbox_orange_off.png" width="16" height="16" style="border: 0;"  alt="tool image"></img> Orange: All package files are present in the data directory, but some esps/esms are not identical. (E.g. another package installed an alternative version of that file, or the user modified the file after installation.)
  * <img src="bash/images/checkbox_yellow_off.png" width="16" height="16" style="border: 0;"  alt="tool image"></img> Yellow: All package files are present in the data directory, but some resource files are not identical. (E.g. another package installed an alternative version of that file, or the user modified the file after installation.)
  * <img src="bash/images/checkbox_white_off.png" width="16" height="16" style="border: 0;"  alt="tool image"></img> White: This is relatively rare. It just means that the package is configured in a way that it has no files to install. This can happen for complex packages where none of the sub-packages are checked.
  * <img src="bash/images/checkbox_grey_off.png" width="16" height="16" style="border: 0;"  alt="tool image"></img> Grey: This indicates that the package has a structure that Bain does not recognize, and so cannot install.
  * <img src="bash/images/checkbox_red_x.png" width="16" height="16" style="border: 0;"  alt="tool image"></img> Red X: The package is corrupt and/or incomplete. You'll likely see this for packages that you are currently downloading into the Installers directory.
* __Icon Shape__
  * <img src="bash/images/diamond_white_off.png" width="16" height="16" style="border: 0;"  alt="tool image"></img> Diamond: A project, i.e. a subdirectory in the Installers directory.
  * <img src="bash/images/checkbox_white_off.png" width="16" height="16" style="border: 0;"  alt="tool image"></img> Square: A mod package archive. Note that only rar, 7z and zip formats are supported.
* __Text Colors__
  * [color=#000080]Navy Blue:[/color] Indicates a package with sub-packages. The files to be installed, and thus the install state of the package will depend on which sub-packages you have activated.
  * [bg=white][color=#BEBEBE]Grey:[/color][/bg] This indicates that the package has a structure that Bain does not recognize, and so, cannot install.
* __Text Background__
  * [bg=#FFBB33]Orange:[/bg] Indicates that the install is dirty. This will occur for packages for which the configuration has been altered (either by altering active sub-packages and esmps, or by altering the package itself). This can be repaired by running Anneal or Anneal All.
  * [bg=yellow]Yellow:[/bg] Indicates that the package has "underrides" i.e. some of its installed files ~~should~~ be overridden by higher order packages. This may happen after reordering mods that have already been installed. It can be repaired by running Anneal or Anneal All.
  * [bg=#E0E0E0]Grey:[/bg] Indicates that some files present in the package will **not** be installed. This is usually due to a complex structure that is only partially handled by Bain, but can also be due to having files that Bain refuses to install (exe's, dlls, sub-archives, etc.)
* __Markers__
  * "Dummy" packages that begin and end with "==".  These are useful for organizing packages into groups.  ==Last== is an example of these.

=== Package Details
Details for the currently selected package will be show on the right. There are (currently) three fields here:
* __Info Tabs__
. The tabs at the top display several types of information relevant to the current mod. Note that much of this information is dependent on the install status of the mod and sometimes it's order.
  * General: Shows summary info and the files to be installed -- as determined by sub-package, esp/m, voice filtering, etc.
  * Matched: Shows files which are identical to current data directory files.
  * Missing: Files which are missing from the data directory.
  * Mismatched: Files which are present in the data directory, but which aren't identical to the package's version of those files.
  * Conflicts: Shows which other packages will conflict the current package and for what files. Note that if a given file is mismatched, but the mismatch isn't due to other packages, then it won't appear. This report can be modified to show inactive conflicts and/or lower order conflicts through [[#|Package Header Commands]].
  * Underridden: Shows packages which ~~should~~ be overridden, but are not, due to install order errors. This can be corrected by running Anneal or Anneal All.
  * Dirty: Shows files which the package previously installed, but which now should be removed or altered due to a reconfiguration of the package. Dirty files can be cleared by running Anneal or Anneal All.
  * Skipped: Shows which files in the package were [[#SkippedFiles|skipped]] by Bain.
* __Sub-Packages__
. This will be blank unless the package has sub-packages. You can determine which of these to install simply by checking the ones you want. Note that sub-packages are installed in the order they appear. So if different subinstallers have different versions of the same file, then the subinstaller that is later in the list (and active) will win.
* __Esp/m Filtering__
. This tab can be used to filter out specific esps and esms from a packages. This is intended for use with packages that provide alternate and optional mods. Note that Esp/m filtering is applied ~~after~~ sub-package filtering. E.g. it may be easier to turn off a sub-package entirely rather than disable individual espms from it.
  *The second function of the Esp/m Filter is to rename files to be installed; Right click on the Esp/m filter will now give a popup menu with these options:
    *Select All
    *Deselect All
    *Rename...
    *Reset Name -> restores a renamed Esp/m to its original name
    *Reset All Names -> restores all Esp/ms to their original names
  *Once an Esp/m is renamed, it will show up with a '*' before its name in the Esp/m filter, and in the tabs will be shown as "original name -> new name"

* __Comments__
. This is a field where you can enter comments about the package. Useful for keeping track of what the package is supposed to do, etc.

=== Package Structure
Bain recognizes three package structures:
* __Simple__
  * If the package has esps, esms or bsas at the top level, or if it has any of the regular Oblivion\Data subdirectories (specifically currently recognized are screenshots, bash patches, distantlod, docs, facegen, fonts, menus, meshes, music, shaders, sound, textures, trees, video, streamline, _tejón, ini tweaks, scripts, pluggy, ini, obse (last one only if option to install OBSE plugins is active)) at that level, then it will be categorized as a simple package.
* __Complex__
  * If a package is not simple, but has subdirectories which appear simple (have esps/esms/bsas and/or have standard sub-directories), then it will be categorized as complex.
  * In this case, each top level subdirectory (that appears simple), will be treated as a sub-package, and you'll be able to activate or deactivate it as desired before installing.
* __Complex/Simple__
  * If a package is complex, but has only one sub-package, then it will appear as a simple package in the interface. (I.e. there will be no sub-package options.)

=== Skipped Files
Bain will skip over (never install) certain types of files in the package.
* __Silent Skip__
. A few files are skipped silently. Files in this group are: Thumbs.db files, and the omod conversion directory and its subfiles.
* __Developer File Skipping__
. Files and directories that begin with '--' (two dashes) and are at either the top level of the package or the top level of a subpackage will be silently skipped.
  * This is for modders who want to keep files related to the project in the project directory, but not have it be considered for syncing with is useful for project directories and files for modders
  * It's also useful for including material in a package archive that is there for background info, but should not be installed. E.g. screenshots, copies of resource readmes, etc.
* __Directory Skipping__
. Bain will skip files from directories that it does not recognize. I.e. it will only install files that go directly into the Oblivion\Data directory or one of its regular subdirectories (Meshes, Textures, Sound, etc.). Files from irregular directories will be skipped unless it is a recognized special dir (ini, ini tweaks, pluggy, scripts, streamline', and '_tejón' etc.) or you select the has extra directories option in which case they will be installed. If files are skipped because of this, you'll find them listed in the debug pane on the right.
* __Extension Skipping__
. Bain will skip files with certain extensions - mostly executables (exe, dll/dlx (unless in the OBSE/plugins directory and then only with a large warning)) and subarchives (7z,zip, etc.). Again, these will be listed in the debug pane on the right. (But only if they're not already skipped because of the directory that they're in.)
* __Other Skips__
. There are a few options in package/header menus to skip certain file types; voices, distandLOD etc. If said option(s) are selected that(those) file type(s) will not be installed for that package/globally.

=== OBSE Plugin Installation
Due to the (theoretical but potentially significant) dangers of installing executable files the only type that can be installed are OBSE plugin dll/x files. 
* __Enabling OBSE dll/x plugin installation__
  * Format archive with OBSE dlls so that the dll(s) are located in <optional subpackage>\obse\plugins\ or a subfolder therein.
  * In BAIN deselect __Skip OBSE Plugins__ in the package header menu.
  * Select install on the package and confirm or block each dll/x - you only have to do it once per dll/version.
* __Saving/Editing allowed/disallowed OBSE plugin dlls list__
  * BAIN stores a list of allowed/disallowed OBSE plugin dlls internally, however if desired you can export, manually edit and import or import to a different copy of Wrye Bash if you desire.
  * To Export: select __Export list of allowed/disallowed OBSE plugin dlls__ from the header menu->setting submenu and save somewhere you will be able to find it later.
  * To edit: just edit that txt file as desired (In case you want to change your mind, accidentally clicked no/yes or just for the fun of it).
  * To Import: select __Import list of allowed/disallowed OBSE plugin dlls__ from the header menu->setting submenu and select a previously exported allowed/disallowed OBSE plugin dlls list.

=== Doc File Sweeping
In order to prevent clutter and centralize doc file storage, Bain will sweep files that appear to be doc files into Oblivion\Data\Docs. Also, files named simply readme.txt (or readme.doc, etc.) will be renamed according to the package name before being swept into the Docs directory.

=== Ordering
Bain assigns an install order to all packages. When packages are installed and/or uninstalled, the order is considered in determining which files will actually be installed/uninstalled.
* __General__
  * Install order is shown the table in the "Order" column.
  * All packages are moved to just before the ==Last== marker when Bain first encounters them.
  * Order can be changed by right clicking on a package (or group of selected packages) and selecting "Move To". Just enter the position to which the packages should be moved. If you're moving many packages at once, they'll keep their relative order, with the "oldest" moving to the specified position, and the others following after it.
  * You can also use Ctrl-Up and Ctrl-Down to change the order of packages.  This preserves their relative load order without moving them as a block.
  * You can also re-order packages by dragging and dropping the package where you want in the load order.  This will only work if the list is sorted by 'Order'
  * A good simple starter ordering would be roughly this sample adjusted as desired:
    * DLC
    * Unofficial Patches
    * DarN
    * Sounds
    * World textures - expandable
    * Environments
    * Weather
    * Other replacers
    * Overhauls - much
    * Overhaul Overrides and Patches
    * Quests
    * Dungeons
    * Locations
    * Houses
    * Unique Landscapes
    * Provinces/LOD
    * Cities and villages
    * Roads and infrastructure
    * Races and Bodies
    * Companions
    * Magic
    * Stealth
    * Combat
    * Scaling and leveling
    * errata
    * newly acquired and testing mods
    * my own projects
    * ====
    * Unused Mods
* __Last__
  * Last is a special marker entry that Bain automatically adds to the archive list. It corresponds to the position at which any newly encountered packages are inserted. if you want specific packages (e.g. your personal projects) to always have high order, then move them to ~~after~~ the ==Last== marker.
* __Install Order__
  * When you install a package, then the order of higher packages will be respected. I.e. if the package being installed conflicts with a higher order package that's already active, then it **won't overwrite** the files from the higher package. Rather, only the files that don't conflict with higher packages will be installed. (However, if you want to overwrite later packages, then you can use the "Install Last" command, which will move the selected packages to the end of the list and then install them.)
* __Uninstall Order__
  * Uninstalling a package will also respect order. Specifically, files that are owned by higher order packages will be left in place. More than that, files that ~~aren't~~ owned by the package being uninstalled will also be left in place. (Hence manually edited mods and files will be left in place.)
  * Also, if a lower order package installed an identical version of a given file, then that file will not be removed. (I.e. ownership will cede to the lower order file.)
  * By the way, you can "uninstall" packages that aren't active. This is useful for cleaning out the files from packages that you have previously installed.
* __Auto-Annealing__
  * When you uninstall packages, Bain will also attempt to "anneal" the file system by restoring any files from active packages that were previously blocked by the packages being uninstalled. If you prefer that Bain ~~not~~ auto-anneal files, then you can deactivate "Auto-Anneal" from the context menu of the column header.

=== Omod Conversion Data
If you're building a triple mode (Bain/Manual/OBMM) project...
* You can use the __Omod Info...__ command to create/update the Omod config file (which contains package name, version, author, etc.)
* For the screenshot, just copy a jpg file to the omod conversion data directory and rename it to "screenshot" (with NO extension).
* If you need a script file, you can create script.txt in the omod conversion data directory. You can edit this file with any text editor. (However, testing/debugging the script is best done in OBMM itself.)
* The info.txt file is __not__ required. (If you export an omod to an archive, it creates an info.txt file in the conversion directory. However, the file is form informational purposes only and can be safely discarded/skipped.)

=== Bain Conversion Files
Bain Conversion Files (BCFs) allow modders to essentially repackage existing archives into a new layout. A BCF doesn't contain any files that are available in the original archives. This means that a BCF is freely distributable, and there is typically no need to worry about permissions.  The only files included in a BCF are any new files that you added to the new layout (typically "package.txt" and *.ini tweaks), and a BCF.dat that tells Bash how to reorganize the files. A BCF is usually under 20kb in size.
* __Notes__
  * BCFs are stored in the __Oblivion Mods\Bash Installers\Bain Converters__ directory. This is referred to as the BCF directory.
  * The fastest way to access this directory is to open Bash, navigate to the Installers Tab, and right-click on the column header and choose "Open...". This opens __Oblivion Mods\Bash Installers__ and you should easily see the BCF directory.
  * BCFs must either end in -BCF.7z or -BCF-*.7z, but the resulting converted archive may use .7z or .zip.
  * BCFs store the configuration settings of the original converted archive.
  * BCFs supports any level of embedded archives within an archive.
  * Any duplicate BCFs in the BCF directory will be moved to __Oblivion Mods\Bash Installers\Bain Converters\--Duplicates__
  * __Important:__ BCFs use what 7z refers to as the "Data CRC" to associate themselves with archives. This "Data CRC" is the cumulative CRC of all the files within an archive, and it is not the same as the CRC of the archive itself.  If two archives contain the same files, even if one is a .zip file and the other a .rar, they will have the same "Data CRC". This means that BCFs ignores both the names of archives and how an archive was compressed. For this reason, Bash displays the "Data CRC" on the General Info tab of projects and archives.
* __Creating a BCF__
  * Add all of the source archives to Bain
  * Create a new project, and rearrange the files until you are satisfied
  * Right-click on the project, and choose "Pack to Archive..."
  * Name the new archive, and choose whether to use solid compression. Solid compression will result in a smaller file size, but will also reduce performance, so it is only really recommended for large archives that won't need to be annealed very often. The name will be used as the default suggestion for the BCF name. If this archive uses solid compression, the converted archive will too.
  * Set any options on the new archive package that you wish to be initially set whenever the BCF is applied.
  * Select all of the source archives in the Installers Tab, right-click and choose "Create..." under the "Conversions" menu. Select the target archive (that you just created and setup), and name the BCF.
  * Look over the result log, and make sure that it looks alright. If there is a large number of contained files in the BCF, you may have chosen the wrong source or target archive.
  * If it looks wrong (large size, large number of contained files), you may either open the BCF directory and manually delete the new file, or you may simply overwrite it by creating a BCF with the same name.
  * If it looks right, you can find the BCF in the BCF for distribution. It is recommended that you copy/paste the result log into your readme for your BCF.
* __Installing BCFs__
You've downloaded a bunch of BCFs.  Now what?
  * Simply copy all of the *-BCF.7z and *-BCF-*.7z files that you downloaded into your BCF directory.
* __Applying a BCF__
  * Bash will only display the BCFs that are currently valid. Valid BCFs are those that end in -BCF.7z or -BCF-*.7z, and have all of their required source archives visible on the Installers Tab.
  * If a source archive has any associated BCFs, you will see them listed when you right-click an archive package and open the "Conversions" sub menu.  If the "Apply" menu is greyed out, then there are no valid BCFs for that particular archive.
  * An asterisk is added to the end of the BCF name for every source archive it requires that you don't have currently selected (but do have installed).
  * Select a BCF from the "Apply" menu.
  * Choose a name for the converted archive, or use the default name suggested.
  * Wait while Bash unpacks the source archive, rearranges the files, and packs the converted archive.
  * Once finished, you are free to delete the original archives if you so desire.

=== Bain Wizards
Bain Wizards allow modders to include a simple configuration script with their packages.  Wizards run on a simple scripting language similar to OBMM script, contained in a __wizard.txt__ file in the package.  For more information on the wizard format, see the [[wizards.html|Wizard Reference]].  When run, the wizard will run through a series of windows to allow you to select options, then show a summary page at the end telling you which sub-packages and esps/esms will be selected, and any INI tweaks that will be applied.
* __Wizard Pages__
  * __[[images/versions.png|Version Warning Page]]:__ Shown when you system doesn't meet the requirements for Oblivion, OBSE, or OBGE for a package.
  * __[[images/selectone.jpg|Single Selection Page]] | [[images/selectmany.jpg|Multi Selection Page]]:__ Allows you to select a single or many options given a prompt.  Images and detailed descriptions can be included for each option.
  * __[[images/cancel.png|Cancel Page]]:__ Shown if the wizard cancelled installation.
  * __[[images/finish.png|Finish Page]]:__ Shown at the end of the wizard.  This will give a list of the sub-packages and esps/esms that will be selected, and INI tweaks that will be applied once the wizard is completed.
* __Wizard Options__
  * __Auto-Anneal/Install Wizard:__ If this is selected, then after a wizard is completed, the package will also be installed/annealed as appropriate.
  * __Auto Wizard:__ When this is selected, any dialogs that are provided with default answers will automatically use these.
* For more information on BAIN Wizards, see the wizards [[wizards.html|documentation]].

=== Package Commands
The following commands are available from context menu of packages.
* __File__
  * __Open:__ Open package(s) in the file system.
  * __Duplicate:__ Duplicate package.
  * __Delete:__ Delete the package(s).
  * __Open at submenu:__
    * __Google:__ Attempts to extract a useable name from the package name and launch a Google search for that name.
    * __TesNexus:__ Attempts to open the TesNexus page for the selected package.
    * __TesAlliance:__ Attempts to open the TesAlliance page for the selected package.
    * __Planet Elderscrolls:__ Attempts to open the Planet Elderscrolls page for the selected package.
      * **These 3 commands may fail!** The function works by assuming that the trailing 1-5 digits in the archives name are a package id at selected Site.
      * If the assumption is wrong, then some random TesNexus/TesAlliance/Planet Elderscrolls page will be selected or an error page.
  * __Hide:__ Hide the package by moving it to Oblivion Mods/Bash Mod Data/Hidden.
  * __Rename:__ Renames the package or marker to the entered text.
* __Archive Info__
  * __Refresh:__ Refreshes all info for selected packages. Useful for updating info when package has been modified outside of Bash.
  * __Move To...__ Moves selected packages(s) to specified position. If multiple packages are active, they'll retain their relative order, but move as a block to the selected position.
  * __Open readme:__ opens the readme if one is detected in the package.
* __Configuration__
  * __Has Extra Directories:__ Ordinarily, Bain will only recognize a limited set of subdirectories of the Data directory -- and files that come from other directories will be skipped over. However if a package has special directories (usually restricted to OBSE scripts), checking this option will cause Bain to recognize these special directories as valid subdirectories (and thus allow them to be installed).
  * __Override Skips:__ If this is checked, Bain will not skip over files that would normally be skipped due to the __Skip XX__ options.
  * __Don't Refresh:__ When refreshing Projects, this package won't get refreshed.  The package will only get refreshed on a Full Refresh, or by manually selecting Refresh.
  * __Skip Voices:__ If this is checked, Bain will skip over any voice files in the package. This is useful if the voice files are empty and/or the user prefers not to use them. If this option is used, then the user should also use Elys' Universal Silent Voice extension ([[http://planetelderscrolls.gamespy.com/View.php?view=OblivionMods.Detail&amp;id=4269|PES]], [[http://www.tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=16622|TesNexus]]) to prevent dialog subtitles from fading too rapidly.
* __Wizard Install Options:__ Only Available if Wizard Install system is active (see the wizards [[wizards.html|documentation]] for more info on the wizard install system)
  * __Wizard:__ Runs the Wizard for the package and sets up the package options as selected in the wizard (only available if wizard.txt exists in the archive).
  * __Auto Wizard:__ Runs the wizard but selects the default options (only available if wizard.txt exists in the archive).
  * __Edit/View Wizard:__ Opens the wizard.txt for viewing o  for projects with a wizard.txt opens it for editing.
* __Install__
  * __Anneal:__ Will "anneal" the selected file(s). This will install any missing files and correct any install order errors (aka "underrides").
  * __Install:__ Will do an "in-order" install. I.e. it will fully install the package except for files that are masked by higher order packages.
  * __Install Last:__ Moves the package to the end of the order list and installs it.
  * __Install Missing:__ The same as Install, except that it only installs missing files -- i.e. it will not override any currently existing files.
  * __Uninstall:__ Uninstalls the package. If Auto-Anneal is active, then files from lower order packages will automatically be restored as necessary.
* __Project__
  * __Conversions__ (Archives only.)
    * __Create:__ Creates a new Bain conversion file.
    * __Apply__ Applies a Bain conversion file.
  * __Pack to Archive:__ (Projects only.) Packs the project to an archive. It defaults to .7z, but also supports .zip. 7z doesn't support writing to .rar and most other relevant formats.
  * __Unpack to Project:__ (Archives only.) Unpack the archive to a project.
  * __Package for Release:__ (Projects only.) Just like "Pack to Archive" except it doesn't archive the following: thumbs.db, desktop.ini, and any folder that begins with "--".
  * __Sync from Data:__ (Projects only.) Synchronize the project with files from the Oblivion\Data directory. This is essentially the reverse of "Install" for projects since it copies from the Oblivion\Data directory to the project rather than the other way around.
  * __Copy Conflicts to Project:__  Copies all files that conflict with the selected package into a new project. Useful for comparing conflicting resources.
  * __OMOD Info:__ (Projects only.) Allows you to read/write omod configuration info. Useful for updating OMOD conversion info for triple mode (Bain/Manual/OBMM) archives.
  * __List Structure:__  Generates a report of the files and directories in a package. Useful for troubleshooting and sharing package details.

=== Package Header Commands
The following commands are available by right clicking on the column header of the Installers tab:
* __Sort by submenu:__
  * __Sort by Active:__ Active installers will be sorted to the top.
  * __Projects First:__ If this is checked, then project packages will be sorted to the top of the table.
  * You can also select which field to sort installers by.
* __Actions:__
  * __Open:__ Opens the Installers directory in Windows Explorer.
  * __Refresh Data:__ Rescans the Data directory and all project directories. Since this operation takes a little while, this scan is ordinarily done only once per Bash session. So, if you have manually edited the directories after that one-time scan, you should run this command to update Bain to the changes.
  * __Full Refresh:__ This does a full refresh of all data files. Notably this will recalculate CRCs for all files (ordinarily CRCs are only calculated for files that seem to have changed). Running this command will likely take 5-15 minutes.
  * __Add Marker:__ Creates a marker for organizing your packages.  The "==" will be added for you.
  * __List Packages:__ Displays list of projects and archives and copies that same list to the clipboard. Useful for posting your package order to forums for install debugging help.
  * __Uninstall All:__ Uninstalls all packages that are managed by BAIN (or at least in the BAIN directory).
  * __Clean Data:__ Removes files from the Oblivion Data dir that are not from one of the following sources:
    * Vanilla Bethesda content (Oblivion.esm, Oblivion - Meshes.bsa, etc.)
    * DLC content (Knights.esp, DLCShiveringIsles.esp, etc.)
    * Wrye Bash (Bashed Patch, 0.esp, INI Tweaks/, etc.)
    * Active BAIN installers
  * Note that this will remove manually installed files or files installed from other programs (like OBMM)
  * For safety's sake the files are not deleted, but rather moved to Oblivion Mods\Bash Installers\Bash\Data Folder Contents (date/time)\
  * __Anneal All:__ This will install any missing files (for active installers) and correct all install order and reconfiguration errors.
  * __Unhide:__ Unhides hidden packages.
    * The Unhide dialog now works like WinMerge's open dialog
      * The default filename is '.Folder Selection.', and acts as selecting the whole folder in the file open dialog
      * So to unhide a project, you would go Unhide...->select the project folder and click 'Open' with '.Folder Selection.' still in the filename box
* __Availability__
  * __Avoid at Startup:__ Toggles Bash to avoid the Installers tab on startup, thus avoiding unnecessary data scanning. Unless you're spending a lot of time in the Installers tab, you'll should Enable this.
  * __Enabled:__ This enables/disables Bain itself. Preferred setting: Enabled (checked).
  * __Show Replacers Tab:__ (Only if the Replacers Tab is enabled in bash.ini) If checked, will cause the Replacers tab to appear.
  * __Auto-Anneal:__ Toggles the auto-anneal process on/off. Preferred setting: enabled.
  * __Auto-Anneal/Install Wizard:__ Toggles whether or not to automatically install/anneal a package when finished with its wizard. (Available only if Wizard Install system is active)
  * __Auto-Refresh Projects:__ Toggles the auto-refreshing of projects on/off. Preferred setting: enabled.
  * __Auto-Refresh Bethsoft Content:__ Toggles whether or not refreshing the Data directory will also scan Bethsoft BSAs, ESPs, and ESMs.  Enabling this option will cause a significant increase in refresh time if the timestamps on the Bethsoft BSAs are changed.  Preferred setting: disabled.
* __Behavior__
  * __BSA Redirection:__ Uses Quarn's [[http://devnull.sweetdanger.net/archiveinvalidation/|BSA redirection technique]] to avoid bugs with the engines texture getting system. This is compatible with both OBMM and Quarn's original BSA redirection approaches.
  * __Clean Data Directory:__ If this is checked, then any empty subfolders of the Oblivion\Data directory will be deleted. This reduces some clutter (especially after uninstalling packages). Removing unused data directories also improves Oblivion.exe performance.
  * __Show Inactive Conflicts:__ If checked, then the conflicts report will show conflicts with inactive as well as active mods. Usually only active conflicts are of interest, however sometimes it's useful to review all conflicting packages.
  * __Show Lower Conflicts:__ If checked, then the conflicts report with show conflicts with lower order packages. If you're only interested in higher order conflicts, the uncheck this to remove some clutter from the report.
  * __Wizard Icon Overlay:__ If checked, installers with a Wizard will have a magic wand image displayed over their icons.
* __Skips__
  * __Skip OBSE Plugins:__ If checked, then files in the Data\OBSE directory will be skipped.
  * __Skip Screenshots:__ If checked, then files from a Data\Screenshots directory will be skipped.
  * __Skip Images:__ If checked, image files will be skipped.
  * __Skip Docs:__ If checked, document files will be skipped vice being swept to the Docs\ directory.
  * __Skip DistantLOD:__ If checked, then DistantLOD files in packages will be ignored. Useful if you're using Tes4LodGen to generate DistantLOD files.
  * __Skip LOD Meshes:__ If checked, landscape LOD meshes will be skipped.
  * __Skip LOD Textures:__ If checked, landscape LOD textures will be skipped.
  * __Skip LOD Normals:__ If checked, landscape LOD normals will be skipped.

== Replacers Tab ==============================================================
**The Replacers Tab has now been replaced by the [[#|Installers Tab]].** If you're currently using Replacers, you should move them to the Packages directory (preferably after converting them to archives).
__As of version 295:__ The Replacers tab has been removed entirely.

=== Textures BSA
If you're currently using the Textures BSA facility, you should switch to using the newer BSA Redirection method instead.
* Uncheck "Automatic".
* Click the "Restore" button to restore the Textures archive to its original state.
* Go to the Installers tab and activate "BSA Redirection" from the main context menu (right click on the main column header).

== Mods Tab ===================================================================
<img src="bash/images/WryeBash_01.png" width="829" height="500" style="border: 0;" alt="Mods Tab"></img>

=== Mods List
* __Sorting__
  * Sort Mod list items by (left) clicking on a column header, or by using the sort submenu of the column popup menu.
  * Reverse a sort by redoing it. E.g., left click on the File column header twice in a row.
    * "Load Order" is the exception -- it will always appear in correct order.
  * Force ESMS to the top of the list by selecting "Sort by Type" from the context menu.
  * Force selected mods to the top of the list by selecting "Sort by Selection" from the context menu.
* __{{A:Activating Mods}}__
  * Activate mods by clicking on the checkbox next to their name or by pressing the space bar when the mod is selected.
    * If multiple mods are selected, the space bar will:
      * If some of the selected mods weren't activated, it activates them.
      * If all of the mods were activated, it deactivates all of them.
      * If none of the mods were activated, it activates all of them.
  * Note: When a mod is activated, it's master mods will also be activated.
  * Conversely, when a mod is deactivated, any mods that depend on it (its "children") will also be deactivated.
* __Text Colors__
  * **[color=blue]Blue:[/color]** An esm file.
  * **[color=green]Green:[/color]** A mod marked as mergeable (see [[#|Merge Patches]]).
  * **[color=black]Black:[/color]** A normal esp.
  * **[color=purple]Purple:[/color]** A mod tagged with NoMerge.
* __Line Colors__
  * **[bg=#FFDCDC]Pink:[/bg]** A file that shares a modification date/time with another file.  Not a problem unless they're both activated, in which case, the lines turn...
  * **[bg=#FF6464]Red:[/bg]**
    * A file that shares a modification date/time with another file -- with both files being activated. This should definitely be corrected! Use details view to change the modification date of one of the files by a second or more.
    * An active file that has the 'Deactivate' tag.  The file should be deactivated to function properly.
  * **[bg=#FF9900]Orange:[/bg]** Exclusion group violation. See [[#|Exclusion Groups]] below.
  * **[bg=#E8E8E8]Grey:[/bg]** A file that is ghosted (see [[#|Auto-Ghost]])
* __Text Styles__
    * **__Slant__:** A file that is recommended to be imported and deactivated (i.e. has the 'Deactivate' tag).
    * __Underline:__ A file identified in the BOSS masterlist as having Dirty Edits (Identical to Master, Deleted References, or otherwise necessary cleaning)
    * __Normal:__ Any other file.
* __Checkbox Types__
  * <img src="bash/images/checkbox_green_on.png" width="16" height="16" style="border: 0;" alt="Active" /> Regular checkmark: mod is active.
  * <img src="bash/images/checkbox_green_inc.png" width="16" height="16" style="border: 0;" alt="Merged" /> Plus sign checkmark: mod is merged into an active [[#BashedPatches|Bashed Patch]] mod.
  * <img src="bash/images/checkbox_green_imp.png" width="16" height="16" style="border: 0;" alt="Imported" /> Dot checkmark: mod is imported into an active [[#BashedPatches|Bashed Patch]] mod.
  * <img src="bash/images/checkbox_green_off.png" width="16" height="16" style="border: 0;" alt="Inactive" /> No checkmark: mod is not active, imported or merged.
* __Checkbox Colors__
  * <img src="bash/images/checkbox_blue_on.png" width="16" height="16" style="border: 0;" alt="Blue" /> <img src="bash/images/checkbox_green_on.png" width="16" height="16" style="border: 0;" alt="Green" /> <img src="bash/images/checkbox_orange_on.png" width="16" height="16" style="border: 0;" alt="Orange" /> <img src="bash/images/checkbox_red_on.png" width="16" height="16" style="border: 0;" alt="Red" />
  * Checkbox colors indicate the "health" of the mod file's master files.
  * Blue or Green: Good.
  * Orange: Some mods have changed order. Oblivion and TESCS will adjust for this when you load. However, if some of the mods that you depend made conflicting changes to the same item, a different mod may now dominate because of the reordering.
  * Red: A master is missing. You should check to make sure that you have not inadvertently renamed or removed the mod.
* __{{A:Exclusion Groups}}__
  * Oftentimes users will have different versions of the same mod, or different mods which do the same sort of thing in an incompatible way. Exclusion groups can be used to help flag these mods so that you don't accidentally activate more than one at once. When an exclusion group is violated, all violating mods will be highlighted in orange.
  * Defining an exclusion group is easy -- just change the name of the mod to include a comma. The part of the name before the comma is the exclusion group.
  * Example:
    * The "Drop Lit Torches in Combat" mod come in several variants with different messages and levels of brightness: plain, B (Brighter), NM (No messages) and BNM (Brighter, No Messages).
    * Rename these to: "Combat Torch, A.esp" (plain), "Combat Torch, B.esp", "Combat Torch, NM.esp" and "Combat Torch, BNM.esp"
  * Other uses:
    * Different versions of the same mod: "Yadda, v01.esp", "Yadda, v02.esp"
    * Different mods of same type: "Overhaul, Oscuro.esp", "Overhaul, Adventurers.esp".

=== Mod Details
* Make changes to the file in the details view.
* __File Name__ Change the file name.
  * Note that changes to the file name are **not** automatically reflected in any mods that have the current mod as their master.
* __Modification Time__ Change the file modification time.
  * Note that this affects file order.
* __Author__ Change the author name.
* __Description and Doc Browser__
  * Edit the mod description.
  * Click on the Document icon to show the [[#|Doc Browser]].
* __Masters List__
  * The masters list show the esm files that the current mod depends on, and the load order (modIndex) of that master.
  * **Renaming Masters:** If a master has been renamed, you can adjust for that here by renaming the master. Either left-click the name and edit it in the column display, or right-click the name, select ~~Change To...~~ and then select the desired replacement esp/esm from the mods directory.
    * Note that you should ~~only~~ do this if the new name is a new version of the same mod. Replacing a mod with an unrelated mod will cause file corruption.
* __Bash Tags__
  * This field lists any bash tags assigned to the current mod. You can alter the tags by right clicking on the field and checking/unchecking specific tags.
  * See [[#|Bash Tags]] for more info.

=== Load Order
* __Background__
  * In case of conflicts between mods (e.g., two mods changing the same race), the last mod to load "wins", i.e., overwrites any changes made by any previous mod.
  * Since load order is determined largely by modified date, load ordering utilities (including Bash) allow you to configure load order by setting the modified date of mods.
  * However, Bash goes further than load ordering -- it maintains the load order of mods by resetting their modified dates as needed.
* __Changing Load Order__
  * You can change the load order of any file by editing it's modified date in the details panel and saving the changes.
  * You can alphabetically sort several mods at once by selecting them and then selecting "File: Sort" from the context menu.
  * You can move files up and down the load order with Ctrl-Up and Ctrl-Down, respectively. This also works when multiple files are selected, and preserves their relative load order.
  * You can select multiple files and use the "Redate" command. The first mod will be moved to the specified date/time, with other mods following at one minute intervals.
  * You can move one or more files in a group (if sorted by 'Load Order'), and drag and drop them to rearrange the load order.
* __Maintaining Load Order__
  * First, make sure that the "Lock Times" option is selected on the column header context menu.
  * Then, after making any changes to mod files, bring the main Bash window to the foreground, and Bash will reset times as needed.
* __Notes__
  * If you want to use another load ordering utility (e.g., Oblivion Mod Manager), then be sure to **turn off** Lock Times first. When you're done using the other utility, you can turn Lock Times back to continue to maintain the new load order.

== Mods Tab Commands =========================================================
These are the commands for the context menu for the mods list. (You'll get this menu by right-clicking on the __header__ of the mods list.)

=== Auto-Ghost
* __Background:__ The Oblivion game engine has a bug which causes performance problems when the number of mods in the Oblivion\Data directory is larger than 300-350 (roughly). (Note that this count includes ~~inactive~~ mods. You would think that Oblivion wouldn't waste time reading inactive mods, but in fact it does. :shrug:)
* __Ghosting:__ To get around this problem, Bash allow you to "ghost" inactive mods. Mods are ghosted simply by adding the extension ".ghost" to their name, and unghosted by removing that extension. If you activate Auto-Ghost, Bash will do ghost and unghost mods depending on whether they are active or not. Activating or deactivating a mod will immediately cause it to ghost/unghost as needed.
* __Interaction Problems:__
 * The main problem with ghosting is that it hides mods not only from Oblivion.exe, but also from non-Bash utilities. To deal with this, you have two options:
    * __Don't Ghost:__ If you have individual files which you do ~~not~~ want to auto-ghost, you can select them and check "Don't Ghost" from their context menu.  If you have multiple files selected, "Don't Ghost" is replaced with a "Ghosting" menu with the following choices:
      * __Allow Ghosting__ - Unchecks "Don't Ghost" for every item.
      * __Disallow Ghosting__ - Checks "Don't Ghost" for every item.
      * __Invert Ghosting__  - Checks "Don't Ghost" if it was unchecked, and unchecks "Don't Ghost" if it was checked.
    * __OR__ Turn auto-ghosting off temporarily, then turn it back on.
  * Bash however, ~~does~~ recognize ghosted files. So Bashed Patch merging, profile switching and Bain will work with ghosted esps.

=== Load Lists
* Aside from using checkboxes to select and unselect mods, you can also use load lists. These are accessed through the column context menu, and work in the same way at the [[#|Load Masters]] command.
* __None:__ Deactivates all mods.
* __Save List...__ Saves your currently activated mods to a new load list.
* __Edit Lists...__ Allows you to delete and rename previously defined load lists.
* __[Load List]__ Synchronizes activated mods to load list.

=== List Mods
* Displays list of currently active mods and copies that same list to the clipboard. Useful for posting your list of mods to forums for load debugging help.
* Note: Merged, imported and group header mods will also be shown.
* Displays mod version and if 'c' is pressed displays mod crcs.

=== Debug Mode
* This feature will activate debug printout. Note that there are few commands for which this will have an effect. (E.g. Update Save Levels... will be affected.)
* This feature is ~~not~~ sticky. I.e. it will default to "off" every time you start Bash.

== Mod File Commands ==========================================================
These are the commands found on context menu for mods...

=== File Commands
* __File Operations__
  * **New Mod:** Create an empty plugin.
  * **{{A:Create Dummy Masters}}:** Creates an empty plugin for each missing master a mod has.  This is useful for allowing TES4Edit to open a 'Filter' patch without having all of the required masters.  These dummy plugins can later be removed using the [[#|Clean Dummy Masters]] command.
  * **{{A:Backup}}** Create a backup of the file (saved with the same name and modification time in %oblivion mods%/bash mod data/backups. Note that backups are also automatically created (see "Revert to Backup" below). If you want to be sure that you can later restore from a specific point, use Duplicate or Snapshot instead. The first time this is run (or if not yet run and Bash is doing changes to an esp for the first time) the backup file will instead be named %filename%.espf/esmf.
    * If multiple files are selected, this is done without any user input.
  * **{{A:Duplicate}}** Creates a duplicate of the file in the mods directory.
    * If multiple files are selected, this is done without any user input.
  * **{{A:Snapshot}}...** Creates a snapshot copy of the current mod in a subdirectory (Bash\Snapshots).
    * Snapshots are indicated by appending to "-l.n.m" to the root of the file name. E.g., "My.esp" becomes "My-01.esp" or "My Mod v1.01.esp" becomes "My Mod v1.01-01.esp".
    * Note that Bash will automatically generate the next available snapshot number. However, you are free to choose a different number if you like.
    * Also, if there's an existing version line (e.g., "Version NN.MM-LL") in the description field of the mod, then it will updated with the new version plus snapshot number when the snapshot is saved.
    * If multiple files are selected, this is done without any user input.
  * **Delete** Deletes the file... **Permanently.**
    * Also deletes all backups and temp files, but **not** snapshots.
  * **Hide** Moves the file to a subdirectory (Bash\Hidden).
    * Use this on seldom used mods to keep them from cluttering the mods listing.
    * This is especially useful when modding, since the TESCS Data list cannot be sorted.
    * Note that there's a corresponding "Unhide..." command in the column context menu.
    * If the file's group is defined (e.g. Heads), and if the Bash\Hidden directory has a subdirectory with the same name (e.g. Bash\Hidden\Heads), then the file will be hidden in it.
  * **Redate** Redates the selected mods to specified date/time. First mod will be moved to the specified date/time, with other mods following at one minute intervals.
  * **Sort** Reorders selected mods to make them sort in alphabetical order.
    * Modified time of first mod is set to time of first selected mod. Other mods follow it at one minute increments.
    * **WARNING: Some mods must be loaded in a certain order (e.g., a patch mod must be loaded after the original). Sort may break that required ordering! Use sort with extreme caution! Note too that there is no "undo" command for sort!**
  * **Revert to Backup** Reverts the file to the last Backup made of it.
    * Bash will make a backup of a file the first time it is significantly changed in an application session.
    * E.g., if you make two or three changes to a file in a given application session, then only the first change will generate a backup.
  * **Revert to First Backup** Same as Revert to Backup, only it reverts to the very first backup that Bash made of the file.
    * The first backup is generated the first time that Bash alters a file, and is never overwritten. Hence it is guaranteed to be free of any problem that Bash might introduce.
    * Of course, this also may mean that it's badly out of date!
  * **Revert to Snapshot** Reverts the file to a selected snapshot.

=== Add Master
* Adds specified master to list of masters, thus ceding ownership of new content of this mod to the new master. Useful for splitting mods into esm/esp pairs.
* **Warning:** For advanced modders only. You should only use this if you know exactly what you're doing.

=== Decompile All
* This command will remove the effects of a 'compile all' by removing all scripts whose texts appear to be identical to the version that they override.
* It ignores/will not work on "Oblivion.esm", "Oblivion_1.1.esm", "Oblivion_1.1b.esm" and "Oblivion_GOTY non-SI.esm".

=== Copy to Esp/Esm
* Creates an esm copy of an esp or vice versa.
* Notes: For esps, the [[#|Espify/Esmify Self]] command will often be more desirable.
* If a mixture of esps and esms are selected, this command is disabled.

=== Espify/Esmify Self
* __Background:__ The distinction between esps and esms is **not** determined by the file extension, but rather by an internal bit of the file. This command flips that bit, making an esp file behave as an esm and vice versa.
* __Esp Mastering:__ Ordinarily, the construction set will not allow one esp to act as a master of another esp. However, the game engine (Oblivion.exe) ~~does~~ allow such mastering. Using this command on an esp will allow that esp to be used as master for other esps.
* __Esm Editing:__ This command ~~should~~ allow esms to be edited, unfortunately, because of some bugginess in the CS, it will crash soon after you save an esm that's been flipped to an esp. Hence the command is disabled for esms. Use [[#|Copy to Esp/Esm]] instead.
* If multiple files are selected, this is only available if the entire selection qualifies to be espified or esmified.
* **Warning:** Leaving mods in an a flipped esm/esp state will likely cause confusion for users and for savegames. Keep in mind that the flipped esp/esm is treated by the game as what it's flipped to. Be sure to flip mods back to their normal state for normal game play and when releasing.

=== Espify/Esmify Masters
* Does the same thing as [[#|Espify/Esmify Self]] except it acts on the esp masters of a given mod. This is useful for editing mods that already have esp masters.
* Note: Command is disabled if mod has no esp masters.

=== Import Face
* See [[#|Face Import]] below.

=== Import Formids
* Systematically replace formids with alternates. **This is for advanced modders only.** Useful if a mod depends on elements from one master, and you want to replace those with equivalent elements from another master.
  * __Example:__ To shift a mod that depends on Tamrielic Ingredients to depend on Cobl instead, it's necessary to systematically replace TI elements with equivalent Cobl elements (e.g. replace TI's AdamantiumOre with Cobl's cobTiRawAdamantium). About 130 types of items need to be replaced, and they need to be replaced in leveled lists, containers, npcs, creatures, etc.
  * __What's Covered:__ All record types are handled. Tes4Edit may also be used instead.
* __Process__
  * First step is generating an old formid to new formid mapper file. This file is basically a spreadsheet (in csv format) that lists all of the old formids and the new formids that they map to. Obviously if you already have such a file, then you can skip this step.
  * Second, you apply the mapper to a given mod to given mod.
    * If you have Tes4View, then you'll probably want to use it since it's easy to use and covers all uses of formids.
    * Otherwise, you can use Wrye Bash with a little bit of preparation.
* __Generate Mapper File__
  * First, create a formid mapper file. This is a csv spreadsheet. You'll find an example at Oblivion\Data\Bash Patches\TI to Cobl_Formids.csv.
    * The columns are:
      * Record type: (ACTI, INGR, etc.). Actually, Bash ignores this column, but it's a good idea to have it set the type of the old formid.
      * Old Mod and Old Object: Together, these constitute the formid (long version) of the original object.
      * Old Eid: The editor id of the old object.
      * New Eid: The editor id of the new object.
      * New Mod and New Object: Together, these constitute the formid (long version) of the replacement object.
    * To build the file, use Export: Editor Ids on both the old and new mods (old mod is the one that defines the objects you'll be replacing, and the new mod is the one that defines the objects you'll be using as replacements). Open these csv files up, then use spreadsheet-fu to merge them into the desired format. You'll likely want to:
      * Trim each spreadsheet before trying to combine them (i.e. chop each list down to just the relevant entries).
      * Move the column of old eids so that it replaces the column of old record types.
      * Sort rows by editor id.
      * After merging the two csv files, you'll need to add and remove cells to make sure that the entries line up correctly.
    * Note that it's okay if either the old side or the new side of a given row is empty. If bash sees that either the old or the new entry is missing, it will ignore the row.
    * Note that the new type does not have to be the same as the old type. E.g. you might replace an old misc. item with a new leveled list. But of course, the types should be compatible. E.g., replacing a spell with a misc. object would be a bad idea.
    * When saving, be sure that the file name ends in __Formids.csv__ and is a __csv format__ file!
* __Using Tes4Edit__
  * Start Tes4Edit with the mod loaded, then select "Batch Change Referencing Records", and the select the XXX_Formids.csv file that you just created. Tes4Edit will apply the changes to every record that uses that formid.
  * **Warning** Tes4View changes **all** uses of the formid, including the definition of the object! E.g. if you edit OOO to get it to use Cobl's version of a lore book instead of OOO's version, then not only will the use of that book in leveled list be changed, so will the definition of the lore book in OOO! I.e. the original distinct record for the formid in OOO will be destroyed. Wrye Bash's Import Formids command is less aggressive in this way -- it only replaces ~~uses~~ of formids, not definitions of them.
* __Using Wrye Bash__
  * Just use the Import: Formids command on the mod with the desired Formids.csv file. You'll get a report afterwards.
    * It's probably a good idea to create a copy of the original file and make the changes on it. That way you can use Tes4View to do a before/after comparison to check the changes. (You'll want to use Tes4View's Compare To... command.)
* __Removing Dependencies__
  * If you've completely swapped from one base mod to another, then you may want to remove the old dependency. You can do that using Tes4Edit (Clean Masters command) or Tes4Gecko (Edit Master List). Note that Tes4Edit will only remove masters that you're not using at all. Tes4Gecko will remove used masters (with appropriate cleanup), and is a bit more manual -- i.e. it will only remove masters that you specify.

=== Export/Import Editor Ids
* Export and import editor ids. This is for advanced modders only. It allows you to export editor ids to a csv file, systematically modify them and then reimport them. I.e., it's only useful if you want to change the editor ids of a lot of items at once.
* Updating Scripts
  * The import command will also update the text of regular scripts (but not quest stage scripts or dialog scripts) to adjust for any name changes.
  * You ~~may~~ have to recompile the scripts after such edits. I don't have enough information to be sure of this, but it seems that I had to recompile some scripts (but not others that were also changed) after making this sort of change. If ~~may~~ be that you only have to change the scripts if you've changed the names of references (which you have to do manually).
  * Suggestions:
    * If no scripts were changed, then don't worry about it. (If any scripts were changed, they'll be reported at the end of the import.)
    * If scripts were changed, then test the mod and recompile if necessary.
  * If you want to change scripts ~~after~~ you've changed the base eids (or perhaps this was done in another mod), then in the spreadsheet add another column after the eid column and put the old eid in it before doing the import.
  . e.g. <code>MISC Oblivion.esm 0x0123456 newEid oldEid</code>

=== Export/Import Factions
* Exports actor factions to an xx_Factions.csv file, and allows importing actor factions into a mod. This is for advanced modders only. It allows you to export actor faction ranks to a csv file, systematically modify them and then reimport them. I.e., it's only useful if you want to change the faction ranks of a lot of actors at once.
* Can also be used in conjunction with [[#|Import Factions]].

=== Export/Import Groups
* Exports/Imports groups for selected mods to/from a xxx_Group.csv file.
* For use with [[#|Balo]].

=== Export/Import Item Data
* (IN DEVELOPMENT - export is almost 100%, import is only partially done)
* Export Item Data exports almost complete object information from the mod to a tab delimited spreadsheet file. You can then edit this file and re-import it (only partially competed), import the file to another mod or use it with the [[#|Import Names]].
* Import Names imports object names from either another mod or a spreadsheet file created by Export Object Names.
* __Notes__
  * Exporting/importing is done on the basis of type (ARMO, BOOK, etc.) and formids.
  * All records in the TESCS "Objects Window" with names are supported. Cells and dialog are not.
  * On import, only the objects that already exist in the mod are affected.
* __Uses__
  * Systematic fast item manipulation for mass changing items in mods.

=== Export/Import Names
* Export Names exports object names from the mod to a tab delimited spreadsheet file. You can then edit this file and re-import it, import the file to another mod or use it with the [[#|Import Names]].
* Import Names imports object names from either another mod or a spreadsheet file created by Export Object Names.
* __Notes__
  * Exporting/importing is done on the basis of type (ARMO, BOOK, etc.) and formids.
  * All records in the TESCS "Objects Window" with names are supported. Cells and dialog are not.
  * On import, only the objects that already exist in the mod are affected.
* __Uses__
  * Systematic name manipulation for mass renaming mods. Also, application of those names to other mods that tweak items. (E.g., applying Rational Names to OOO.)
  * Mod translation. This automates some of the work in mod translation. E.g., if an English mod re-balances weapons, the re-balanced items will have the English names. But by importing names from a German version of Oblivion.esm, you'll quickly revert those items to the German names.
    * For new items, export the names from the revised mod, edit the resulting spreadsheet and then re-import it.
    * Of course, this is only part of the work in localization. Cells are not affected, nor are racial voices.
* __Import Names Patcher__
  * The exported file can be distributed for use by other users with the [[#|Import Names]] Patcher. There are some advantages to this over using a renaming mod:
    * Single file can cover multiple mods. Names for mods that aren't loaded will be ignored.
    * One less esp in your mods directory!

=== Export/Import NPC Levels
* **Export NPC Levels** exports the NPC level info from a mod to a comma separated spreadsheet file. This file can then be edited and re-imported using **Import NPC Levels.**
* __Notes__
  * This is an **advanced function** intended for modifying overhaul mods like ~~Oscuro's Oblivion Overhaul.~~ Editing the level files takes a bit of thought and work, but once done the level files can be posted for other players to use.
  * NPC leveling is only part of the leveling system. Leveled item lists also have a major impact, and there are creature levels as well -- neither of which is addressed by this feature.
  * NPC levels in existing saves will not be impacted by this, unless you then use the "Update NPC Levels" command on the save. ~~(Note that while mods import levels from a csv file, saves import their levels from a mod.)~~
* __File Format__
  * The file format is pretty straightforward -- you should be able to read/edit it with most spreadsheet programs. When reading be sure to set the program to recognize tabs as separators. Also, be sure to save in the same comma separated format.
  * Two differing formats are supported (one is for backwards compatibility).
  * __New Format__
    * The first column is the mod that the data was exported from. It restricts the import of the data on that line to the named mod. Replace the mod name with "Any" (ignoring the quotes) to allow that line of data to be imported into any mod that has that record.
    * The second column is the editor id. This is for convenience only and is ignored on import.
    * The third and fourth column contain the formid ~~do not edit these!~~
    * The next three columns are the leveling info
    * The last four columns are the original NPC levels from Oblivion.esm. If the NPCs are new to the mod, these columns will be blank. These are for convenience only and are ignored on import.
  * __Old Style Format__
    * The first column is the formid -- ~~do not edit these!~~
    * The second column is the editor id. This is for convenience only and is ignored on import.
    * The next three columns are the leveling info
    * The last four columns are the original NPC levels from Oblivion.esm. If the NPCs are new to the mod, these columns will be blank. These are for convenience only and are ignored on import.
  * The New Format allows multiple mods to be included in the same csv file.
  * When the Old Style Format is read, it is treated as if the source mod field was set to "Any".
  * Note that only NPCs that are dynamically leveled (i.e., offset from the player's level) are included in the export file. The "Old IsPCLevelOffset" and "bOffset Oblivion" columns indicates whether the NPC was also dynamically offset in Oblivion.esm.

=== Export/Import Relations
* Exports faction relation(ships)s to an xx_Relations.csv file, and allows importing faction relation(ships)s into a mod. This is for advanced modders only. It allows you to export faction relation(ships)s to a csv file, systematically modify them and then reimport them. I.e., it's only useful if you want to change the faction relation(ships)s of a lot of actors at once.
* Can also be used in conjunction with [[#|Import Relations]].
* Note: This does not export race relations.

=== Export/Import Prices
* These paired functions allow you to export prices to a csv files, edit the file and then reimport the prices data. Mainly developed for use by Economy Overhaul.
* __Uses__
  * Using an external editor with better editing capabilities.
  * Editing in a systematic manner all the prices for items.

=== Export/Import Sigil Stones
* These paired functions allow you to export sigil stone details to a spreadsheet file, edit the file and then reimport the stats.
* __Uses__
  * Using an external editor with better editing capabilities.
  * Editing in a systematic manner all the sigil stone details.
* __Spreadsheet Format__
  * The spreadsheet is written/read as a csv file. After making changes, be sure to save in this format. Also, stat values must be numbers, not formulas.
  * Any line in which the entry in the second column does not begin with "0x" will be ignored when Bash reads the file, and so can be used for comments, etc.
  * More effects may be added as long as they follow the same listed format with one blank column between each effect.
  * If any of the Script Effect columns are set to "None", all the Script Effects values for that effect will be ignored.

=== Export/Import Stats
* These paired functions allow you to export ammo, apparatus, armor, book, clothing, ingredient, key, light, misc object, sigil stone, soulgem  and weapon stats to a spreadsheet file, edit the file and then reimport the stats. The exported file can also be used with the [[#|Import Stats]].
* __Uses__
  * Systematically editing weapon statistics to fit a weapon quality paradigm (e.g. Medieval Oblivion Balance System (MOBS)) or systematically editing object prices to fit a scheme. The spreadsheet makes it easy to view and edit the stats in a systematic way.
  * Patching miscellaneous mods to fit a balance system through [[#|Import Stats]]. Stats for items for multiple mods can all be covered in a single spreadsheet file. The stats patcher will then apply changes only for those mods that are active when the patch is updated.
* __Spreadsheet Format__
  * The spreadsheet is written/read as a csv file. After making changes, be sure to save in this format. Also, stat values must be numbers, not formulas.
  * Any line in which the entry in the third column does not begin with "0x" will be ignored when Bash reads the file, and so can be used for comments, etc.

=== Export/Import Scripts
* These paired functions allow you to export scripts to a series of text files, edit the file(s) and then reimport the script text.
* __Uses__
  * Using an external editor with better editing capabilities
  * The scripts are each individually written/read as a text file (using default extension of .txt, but settable via Bash's Ini). Do not change the first three lines unless you know what you're doing. Change the rest of it however you want.
  * After changing import and then 'recompile all' scripts in the cs, then in Bash run decompile all (at least that's the quickest method if there are more than a few changed scripts.
  * As of version 283 can also now import and build the record for new scripts.

=== Export/Import Spell Stats
* These paired functions allow you to export spell stats to a spreadsheet file, edit the file and then reimport the stats. The exported file can also be used with the [[#|Import Spell Stats]]. These functions have a basic and detailed mode. They do not support JRoush's OBME at this point.
* __Basic__
  * Only the form Id, editor Id, name, cost, level type, and spell types are exported/imported
* __Detailed__
  * All basic fields are exported/imported as well as a variety of flags and all spell effects
* __Uses__
  * Systematically editing spell statistics to fit a spell quality paradigm etc. The spreadsheet makes it easy to view and edit the stats in a systematic way.
  * Patching miscellaneous mods to fit a balance system through [[#|Import Spell Stats]]. Stats for spells for multiple mods can all be covered in a single spreadsheet file. The spell stats patcher will then apply changes only for those mods that are active when the patch is updated.
* __Spreadsheet Format__
  * The spreadsheet is written/read as a csv file. After making changes, be sure to save in this format. Also, stat values must be numbers, not formulas.
  * Any line in which the entry in the third column does not begin with "0x" will be ignored when Bash reads the file, and so can be used for comments, etc.
  * More effects may be added as long as they follow the same listed format with one blank column between each effect.
  * If any of the Script Effect columns are set to "None", all the Script Effects values for that effect will be ignored.

=== Details
* Displays list of records in mod, similar to Details view in TESCS.

=== List Masters (Mod)
* Displays list of masters for mod, and copies same list to the clipboard.

=== Create BOSS Report
* Generates a report on the selected mods, for posting in the latest BOSS thread.  The report includes the plugin name, a link to the download (if it can be determined from the installer), the plugin version, plugin CRC, and ITM and UDR counts (as determined by Wrye Bash, so the ITM count may be less than what TES4Edit reports).

=== Copy Mod Info
* Generates a report on the selected mod(s) with the info from the currently displayed columns (ie size, author etc.).

=== Mark Levelers
* Obsolete. Replaced by automatic tagging (see [[#|Bash Tags]]).

=== Mark Mergeable
* Scans the selected mods to determine if they are mergeable or not.
* Use of this command is optional since it basically replicates a scan that Bash automatically does on any new or changed files. However, this command may still be useful to modders since it reports ~~why~~ unmergeable mods are unmergeable.
* See also [[#|Merge Patches]].
* __Note: Changes as of Bash v217__
  * Use of the command is now optional. (Previous to v217, Bash did not autoscan for mergeability.)
  * <code>Merge</code> [[#BashTags|Bash tag]] is no longer used. Instead Bash remembers internally whether a given mod is mergeable or not.
* __Note: Changes as of Bash v278__
  * The <code>NoMerge</code> will prevent a mod from being marked as Mergeable, make the mod text be black and be excluded from the Bashed Patch's MergePatches list, however the NoMerge tag will be listed in the mark mergeable dialogue as the reason it is not mergeable.

=== Nvidia Fog Fix
* Systems with Nvidia cards can suffer a black screen bug when the player enters interior cells where near fog, far fog and fog clipping distance are all equal to 0. To avoid this, this function scans the mod and sets near fog to 0.001 in problem cells.
* This feature is based on Quarn's [[http://planetelderscrolls.gamespy.com/View.php?view=oblivionmods.detail&amp;id=2859|Nvidia Black Screen Fix]]
* It is advised that modders run this function on their mods before releasing.

=== Rebuild Patch
* See [[#|Bashed Patches]].

=== List Patch Config...
* Displays a summary of how you have configured your Bashed Patch.
* This summary will also be copied to your clipboard, so all you have to do to post it on a forum for help is paste it into a post.

=== Export Patch Config...
* Exports the Wrye Bash readable patch configuration for your Bashed Patch to a file without loading mergeability and stuff that takes a bit of processing.

=== Remove World Orphans
* This command is for modders and advanced players only. Less experienced players will generally **not** need to use this.
* Techie Explanation
  * Some mods have a mild corruption in their file structure called "Orphaned World Groups". This happens when the world record that should be precede all groups of exterior cells is missing from the mod.
  * The corruption seems to happen automatically due to a mild bug in the construction set. If a mod is edited in the CS; and the mod has an esp master; and the esp master has exterior world cells; then the children cells for that master are added to the mod being edited regardless of whether the dependent mod edits them or not. But the matching world record is not edited. Hence: orphaned world groups.
  * It's not really known if the orphaned world groups will cause any problem. At the least, they're unnecessary. Hence modders should probably remove them from their own mods.
  * If you have orphaned world groups, it will be mentioned by bash when you're rebuilding the Bashed Patch. You can also see them while reviewing the mod in Tes4View -- you'll see a world group without a corresponding world record.
  * This command simply removes the orphaned world groups from the mod.

=== Undelete Refs
* ~~__EXPERIMENTAL__~~
* This command is for advanced modders only. If you don't know what it does, you don't need it. If you do need it, you should probably use TES4Edit instead.
* Techie Explanation
  * Oblivion can crash if one mod deletes a references and a mod later in the load order references the deleted reference.
  * One solution to this problem is to undelete the deleted reference, and mark it initially disabled instead.
  * One problem with this is that deleted reference records contain a bare minimum of information, and Bash doesn't add back the missing data. TES4Edit does.

=== Version 0.8
* Resets the file version number of a mod file back to an older version (0.8) so that the older construction set can edit it. The feature is somewhat dated now that the updated construction set is available, but is still useful for modders who prefer to work with the older CS. (Note that the newer CS has some bugs that the older CS does not.)
* **Warning:** It's possible that using this command on mods built under newer versions of the CS may result in loss of some data. Use with caution.

=== Clean Dummy Masters
* Removes any empty plugin files that were generated via the [[#|Create Dummy Masters]] command.

== Balo =======================================================================
Bash Auto Load Ordering (aka Balo) will semi-automatically sort your mods into a few predefined groups. Currently it's still necessary to specify for each mod which group it belongs to, but future versions of Balo may provide additional automation in this area.
__As of version 292:__ Balo and all of its options are disabled by default.  They can be enabled through bash.ini, however, Balo may be removed completely in future versions.

**Warning: If you already have an established load order, using this feature will likely substantially rearrange them! Use at your own discretion!**

=== Full Balo
Full Balo enforces a number of rules on your mods:
* All mods must be assigned to a group. If no group is currently assigned, then the mod will be assigned to the special group "NONE".
* Group names can only have letters, spaces and underscores.
* Groups can have offset groups ranging from Group-10 up to Group+10.
* Groups do not interleave.
* All mods, except those within the NONE group, are automatically sorted.
* Mods within the NONE group may be moved up and down relative to each other, but cannot be interleaved with mods in other groups.
* Two special groups have additional limits:
  * NONE is always next to last. It cannot have offset groups.
  * Last is always last.

=== Full Balo Usage
* __Turn on Full Balo__
  * On mods tab, right click on column header and select "Full Balo".
  * This will bring up the Balo Groups dialog...
* __Define Groups__
  * You'll get this dialog when you first activate Full Balo. You can also get it at any time that Full Balo is active by right clicking on a mod and selecting "Group: Edit..."
  * On first usage, you'll probably get the [[#|Default Groups]] listed below.
    * It is **strongly advised** that you not change the names or order of these groups. The default groups may later be used by mods to automatically specify their load order.
    * The default groups will probably be sufficient for your needs. However, you may want to add some new groups as well.
  * Add/rename/remove/reposition groups as desired. (But again, keep in mind the utility of the default groups.)
    * Note: You cannot remove groups that are currently in-use.
  * Usually, you'll only want to modify the allowed offsets for groups.
    * Select any group and use the spin boxes to set the allowed offsets in either direction.
    * Offsets can only be reduced when the offset are not in use. E.g. if you have mods assigned to Overhaul-1, then the minimum that you'll be able to set the lower offset for Overhaul to is -1.
  * Click "Save" to save changes. This will create new groups, and group headers and set the relative loader order of all selected groups.
* __Assign Mods to Groups__
  * Select one or more mods (you can use shift and control keys to select multiple mods).
  * Right click one of selected mods and choose "Group: [Group Name]" to assign the selected mods to that group.
  * As soon as the group is assigned, the selected mods will immediately be resorted in alphabetical order under the group header for that group.
* __Automatic Grouping__
  * Balo will automatically assign groups to mods the first time it encounters them. This will happen either when you turn Full Balo on, or when you add new mods to your mods directory and then return to Bash's screen.
  * If the mod is tagged with "Group: GroupName", then that mod will be assigned to group GroupName -- if that's a valid balo group.
  * If the mod is listed in Oblivion\Data\Bashed Patch\Bash_Groups.csv directory, then the group listed there will be used -- if it's a valid balo group.
  * Otherwise the mod will be assigned to group NONE.
  * To turn off automatic grouping.
    * Uncheck "Auto Groups" just above "Full Balo".
    * With Auto Groups turned off, all unknown mods will be assigned to "NONE" group.

=== Default Groups
Balo provides a default "canonical" set of groups designed to reduce problems due to conflicts between mods.
* __Base Groups__
  * __Root:__ Oblivion.esm, TCs
  * __Library:__ Common library esms and their glue esps. E.g. Cobl, Partners
  * __Cosmetic:__ Cosmetic mods (Hair, Eyes, Races). Face replacers, Hair, Eyes. PC/NPC Animations
  * __Clothing:__ Clothes and armor.
  * __Weapon:__ Weapons.
  * __Tweak:__ Mods that tweak some aspect of Oblivion.
    * Smaller than overhauls (which tend to be mega-tweaks).
    * Tend to be included in/overridden by overhauls.
  * __Overhaul:__ OOO, MMM, FCOM, etc.
  * __Misc.:__ Misc. scattered additions. E.g. Clocks of Cyrodiil, Ambient sounds, Landmarks w wells.
  * __Magic:__ Magic additions.
  * __NPC:__ Companion mods.
  * __Home:__ House mods.
  * __Place:__ Towns, villages, Unique landscapes.
  * __Quest:__ Quest mods.
  * __NONE:__ Special group.
  * __Last:__ Mods that are supposed to load last(ish).
    * It's a good idea to reserve the base "Last" group to Bashed Patches, and then use Last-1, Last+1 offset groups for other late loading mods.

=== Semi-Balo
* __Group Headers__
  * Group Headers are special empty mods that act as "anchors" for the mods in a sorting group. You'll find these mods at the top of their respective groups with names like "++ROOT========.esp".
  * Full Balo automatically creates and removes headers as necessary. However, if you aren't using Full Balo, you can still take advantage of some special sorting rules associated with group headers.
  * **Full Balo users should skip the rest of this section.**
* __Manual Setting__
  * It's possible to define your own group headers and rearrange the relative order of existing group headers.
  * A group header is defined by two things: 1) membership in the specific group, and 2) a mod name that begins with "++". Hence, you can define new groups and change the name of existing group headers so long as you follow these rules. However, it's usually best to follow existing scheme of "++[GROUP NAME]========.esp" since this is more consistent, and makes group headers stand out.
  * You can change the relative position of group headers by changing their "Modified" time in the field to the right. But... Be sure that the modified times of header groups are at least 1 day apart. Otherwise, groups may end up overlapping.
  * If you need to create a new header from scratch, click an existing mod and choose File: "New Mod..."
* __Unsorted Group Headers__
  * It's possible to define an unsorted group header. Just use same procedure as above, but preface the group header name with '==' instead of '++'.
  * However, unsorted group headers are purely cosmetic. They're mainly only useful since they're highlighted and appear in mods lists just like auto-sorted groups.)

=== Auto-Assigning Groups
* Modders can tag their mods so that they'll automatically be assigned to a group the first time Bash sees them. Note that this will only work the ~~first~~ time that Bash sees the mod.
* To tag a mod, include the line "Group: [Group Name]" in the description field of the mod. (E.g. "Group: Tweak+1".) The tag must be on a line by itself.

== Bashed Patches =============================================================
<img src="bash/images/WryeBash_05.png" width="686" height="492" style="border: 0;" alt="Bashed Patchers"></img>
A __Bashed Patch__ is a configurable, custom built patch. The patch can have multiple components, which you can choose and configure as you like. You can also have multiple patches (typically, you would have one patch per major set of load mods).

=== Patch Usage
* __Select a Bashed Patch__
  * Probably Bash has automatically created one for you. If not, you can copy the blank one from Oblivion\Mopy\Extras to Oblivion\Data.
  * Note that the author of the mod must be set to __Bashed Patch__.
* __Configure the Patch__
  * Right click on the Bashed Patch and select "Rebuild Patch..." This will bring up a dialog in which you can activate and configure various patcher components.
  * To activate a component, just click its checkmark box.
  * To configure a component, select it. Note that:
    * Most components will try to automatically configure themselves, but you may still need to tweak their settings.
    * Some components do not need to be configured (e.g., [[#|Alchemical Catalogs]]).
    * Configuration of specific components is covered below.
    * the Select All button (where available) will select all items and if the item has a choice (i.e. in Tweak Settings) will select the first one in the list.
  * __Revert To Saved:__ Restores the last saved configuration for your Bashed Patch.  Basically, this is a giant Undo button for any changed you may have made this session.
  * __Export Patch Configuration:__ Saves your Bashed Patch's configuration into an external file for backup.
  * __Import Patch Configuration:__ Restores your Bashed Patch's configuration by reading an external file saved using the __Export Patch Configuration__ command.
* __Build the Patch__
  * Once you have at least one component selected, the OK button will become enabled. Click on it to update the patch, or click Cancel to quit without updating the patch mod.
  * If specified in the bash.ini a sound will be played on succesfull completion/failure.

=== Patch Notes
* __Load Order__
  * Bashed Patches should be last or nearly last in the load order. Only mods that load before the patch will be processed in the update process.
* __Unloading a Patch Master__
  * When you unload (remove from the load list) a mod that a Bashed Patch is dependent on, then the patch will also become unloaded. In this, case, you should **update the patch before reloading it.**
  * If you reload the patch before updating, it will force reload of all its masters -- including the one you just unloaded!
* __Replacing a Previous Patch__
  * If you're creating a new patch to replace an existing patch, **be sure that the older patch is unloaded!**
  * Otherwise the older patch may interfere with building the newer patch.
* __One Patch per Loadset__
  * Do you typically switch between different sets of loaded mods? Then you should probably have one Bashed Patch for each set. I typically have a different [[#SaveProfiles|Save Profile]] for each such loadset, and then name the corresponding patch after the set. E.g., for save profiles ~~Elise 1~~ and ~~Elise 2~~, I have Bashed Patches: ~~Bashed Patch, Elise 1.esp~~ and ~~~Bashed Patch, Elise 2.esp~~.
* __{{A:Automatic Lists}}__
  * Several of the patch components ([[#|Leveled Lists]], [[#|Import NPC Faces]]) have automatic lists. In these, the list is automatically generated based on Bash Tags.
* __Examining/Editing__
  * It's slightly difficult to view the contents of a Bashed Patch, since it uses esp-mastering (i.e., it has esps as well as esms as masters).
  * If you just want to examine the patch, you may want to use [[http://www.tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=11536|Tes4View]] which will allow you to browse the structure, and more importantly compare its data with other loaded mods.
  * However, if you would like to open/edit in TESCS, then you'll need to use the [[#|Espify/Esmify Masters]] command. (Be sure to Espify Masters before playing.)

=== Bash Tags
* Several of Bash's features (e.g., automatic selection) of mods require that the source mods be tagged with Bash Tags. You can view and edit the tags that are currently assigned to any mod in the Bash Tags field at the bottom right of the Mods tab.
* __{{A:Current Tags}}:__
  * Actors.ACBS: Mod Modifies the Creature or NPC ACBS configuration (such as fatigue, etc.) ([[#|Import Actors]])
  * Actors.AIData: Mod modifies Creature or NPC AI Data ([[#|Import Actors]]).
  * Actors.AIPackages: Mod modifies Creature or NPC AI Packages list ([[#|Import Actors]]).
  * Actors.AIPackagesForceAdd: force the addition of packages even if earlier in the lo they had been removed ([[#|Import Actors]]).
  * Actors.Animations: Mod modifies Creature or NPC special Animations list(s) ([[#|Import Actors]]).
  * Actors.CombatStyle: Mod modifies the Creature/NPC assigned combat style(s) ([[#|Import Actors]]).
  * Actors.DeathItem: Mod modifies Creature or NPC Death Item(s) ([[#|Import Actors]]).
  * Actors.Skeleton: Mod modifies Creature or NPC Skeleton(s) ([[#|Import Actors]]).
  * Actors.Spells: Mod modifies Creature or NPC Spell list ([[#|Import Spells]]).
  * Actors.SpellsForceAdd: Force the addition of spell(s) even if earlier in the lo they had been removed([[#|Import Spells]]).
  * Actors.Stats: Mod modifies Creature or NPC stats ([[#|Import Actors]]).
  * Body-F: Mod modifies female body texture/mesh definition ([[#|Race Records]]).
  * Body-M: Mod modifies male body texture/mesh definition ([[#|Race Records]]).
  * Body-Size-F: Mod modifies female body weight/height definition ([[#|Race Records]]).
  * Body-Size-M: Mod modifies male body weight/height definition ([[#|Race Records]]).
  * C.Climate: Mod changes cell climate ([[#|Import Cells]]).

  * Voice-M: Mod modifies male voice definition ([[#|Race Records]]).
* __Manual Tagging__
  * You can manually set the tags that are applied to any mod by right clicking in the Bash Tags field and checking and unchecking tags as you like. Manual tags are shared for all users on a given computer.
  * If you have edited tags but want to revert to automatic tagging, just right click and choose "Automatic".
  * Modders may want to copy their tags to the Description field before releasing their mod (this will make your tag settings automatic for users of your mod). Again, right click and choose "Copy to Description".
* __Automatic Tagging__
  * If the bash tags field is set to "Automatic" for a given mod (which is by default), then Bash will attempt to automatically tag the mod according to all available of several sources. These sources are:
    * The description field.
    * BOSS (Better Oblivion Sorting Software) masterlist.txt file. This file includes bash tags for some of the mods it has listed. Note that you do ~~not~~ need to use BOSS in order to benefit from this. All that's required is that BOSS's masterlist.txt file be present in the Oblivion\Data folder (or for the newest BOSS version in Oblivion\BOSS). Also with the newest BOSS version reads the userlist.txt file; APPEND for bash tags is as it sounds, Bash adds them to the list of tags, REPLACE replaces the BOSS masterlist tagging suggestions with the userlist suggestions, neither does anything to the existing tags from the description.
    * Bash Patches\Leveled Lists.csv file. This file has a very small list and is largely surpassed by BOSS. (But is useful for people who don't have BOSS installed.)
    * Bash Patches\taglist.txt (if the masterlit.txt doesn't exist); it is a stripped down (and at times outdated) version of the BOSS Masterlist
  * Keep in mind that there is no guarantee that all mods will be correctly tagged. However, between the description field and BOSS, most important tags are covered.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
__General Configuration:__ The first three patch "components" control the behavior of the patch generation in a general way.

=== Alias Mod Names
* Users sometimes rename mods in order to improve usability or allow different versions of the same mod (e.g., "Oscuros_Oblivion_Overhaul.esp" to "OOO.esp"). Naturally this will confuse bash when it tries to read an imported text file which uses the old "canonical" name. To compensate for this, this component can be used to alias the canonical name to the local name.
* Examples:
<pre>
Oscuro's_Oblivion_Overhaul.esp >> OOO.esp
Bob's Mod with a very, very long name.esp >> Bob's Mod.esp</pre>

=== Merge Patches
* This component causes Bash to fully merge the content of specified patch files into the Bashed Patcher, thus allowing you to remove the patch mod from the load order.
* __Notes:__
  * Most mod files are **not** mergeable. To be mergeable by Bash, the mod must:
    * Only contain record types that Bash recognizes (e.g., no game settings, cells, dialog, etc.)
    * Not contain any new records -- i.e., it must only patch records that already exist.
  * Determination of whether a given mod is mergeable or not is done automatically by Bash. Mods that are mergeable are marked with green text in the main mod list. If a given mod is not mergeable and you would like to know why, run the [[#|Mark Mergeable]] command on it. (Note that the old "Merge" tag is now ignored.)
  * If during construction of the patch, records in the mod are overridden by another mod that loads after it, then the later loading mod will win. In other words, the ordinary record shadowing rules are applied while merging. (Hence, it can be useful to think of a merged mod as being __virtually active__.)
  * __Do not remove merged mods from your mods directory!__ They need to be available for when you next rebuild the patch. (Every time you rebuild the patch, you rebuild it from scratch, hence the original mods need to be available to be re-merged.)

=== Replace Form IDs
* Allows references to one formID to be swapped for a different formId. Please see [[#|Import Formids]] for details. This component performs the same task, except the changes are made in the Bashed Patch instead of on the mod itself.
* __Configuration:__
  * Source text files are automatically recognized if they are in the <code>Oblivion\Data\Bash Patches</code> directory and end with <code>Formids.csv</code>.
* __Source CSV Files__
  * Please see [[#|Import Formids]] for details.

=== Merge Filtering
* This is advanced option that allows records in a merged mod to be selectively filtered according to the current load list. E.g., suppose a patch mod modifies records from MMM and OOO. This feature can be used to discard the changes to MMM if MMM is not currently loaded. The advantage of this is that, rather than having two separate patch mods (one for MMM and one for OOO), it's possible to have just one patch mod for both.
* __Limitations__
. This is an advanced option that can be taken advantage of by advanced modders -- but beware, it can be a little confusing.
  * This will only work for mods that are mergeable and are tagged with <code>Filter</code>.
  * The mod being filtered must not be active at the time the patch is built.
  * Filtering is mostly limited to the top level.
    * E.g., if MMM is not loaded, then changes to MMM specific records will be skipped.
    * However, if a record has been changed so that it refers to a record from a mod that is not loaded -- then that reference will (usually) not be filtered out. Hence the Bashed Patch will end up dependent on that mod after all.
  * Deep Filtering:
    * Entries in leveled lists will be filtered. E.g. if a leveled list has items from MMM, but MMM is not active, then the MMM entries will be discarded.
    * For creatures and NPCs, spells, factions and items will be filtered.
  * Filtering is done according to the currently active mods. __Hence, it is important when building the patch, to make sure that all desired mods are activated!__ It this isn't the case, then the patch is likely to end up ~~not~~ including changes from the filtered mod that it should include.

=== Item Interchange Mode
* This is a hack designed to support Vacuity's Item Interchange Mode. It's a "hack" because it's horribly inelegant and is inconsistent with the rest of bash patching approach. But it works and its simpler than rewriting a bunch of code to support a special case.
* II Mode is triggered by the <code>IIM</code> tag -- but only when the mod is being patch merged in. Probably. In any case, you should only use it for mods that are being patch merged. Such modes should be [[#MergeFiltering|Filtered]] as well.
* What it does:
  * Prevents the records from the mod from being merged into the patch. I.e. although the patch is marked as "Merged" and is supposedly merged in, in fact it's not. Except for leveled list records. Those go in.
  * Prevents all patch components except for the leveled list merger and the inventory importer from even looking at the mod. Leveled list merger treats the mod in the usual way. However, the inventory import mod treats the mod record specially, ignoring all changes except inventory changes. The point of this is to cause Inventory Import to import ~~only~~ inventory. Thus II mods can "load" after the mod that they change and yet be guaranteed to only modify inventory.
* Ugh. But it works for II. :sigh:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
__Importers__ are components that import specific information from selected mods and/or text files and incorporate that into the patch file.

=== Import Actors
* Allows certain changes to actors (creatures and NPCs) to be imported from source mods. One main patcher and several secondary patchers.
* __Configuration__
  * Source mods for the main patcher ~~must~~ contain one (or more) of the following tags:
    * Actors.ACBS: Mod modifies the Creature or NPC ACBS configuration (such as fatigue, etc.).
    * Actors.AIData: Mod modifies Creature or NPC AI Data.
    * Actors.CombatStyle: Mod modifies the Creature/NPC assigned combat styles.
    * Actors.Skeleton: Mod modifies Creature or NPC skeleton(s).
    * Actors.Stats: Mod modifies Creature or NPC stats.
    * Creatures.Blood: Mod modifies the creature blood subrecords.
    * NPC.Class: Mod modifies the designated classes of NPCs.
* __Usage__
  * For selected mods, each of the tags will import the related information into the Bashed Patch if necessary.
  * In cases where two source mods modify the same Actor in the same way, then the later loading source mod will win. If they modify the same actor in different ways (e.g. one changes AIData, the other changes DeathItem), then both changes will be included in the patch if properly tagged and selected.

=== Import Actors: AIPackages
* This option will merge changes to npc, and creature AIPackage lists from the selected mods. Only mods marked with the <code>Actors.AIPackages</code> will appear in the list.
  * Merges change likes Import Inventory but for the AIPackage list.

=== Import Actors: Animations
* This option will merge changes to npc, and creature animations (the KFFZ subrecord) from the selected mods. Only mods marked with the <code>Actors.Animations</code> will appear in the list.
  * (note: direct import rather than merge - this will hopefully be fixed next version (285))

=== Import Actors: Death Items
* This option will merge changes to npc, and creature death items from the selected mods. Only mods marked with the <code>Actors.DeathItems</code> will appear in the list.

=== Import Actors: Spells
* This option will merge changes to npc, and creature spells lists from the selected mods. Only mods marked with the <code>Actors.Spells</code> or <code>Actors.SpellsForceAdd</code> [[#BashTags|tag]] will appear in the list.
  * Sometimes it's desirable to change only the spells of an actor. This is desirable when modifying the spells of creatures that have been changed by overhauls -- especially when you can't rely on the overhauls being present.
  * For a mod to override only the spells, the mod must be tagged with one of those two tags and must be inactive during build and only imported into the patch (i.e. if mergeable also tag NoMerge or tag Deactivate to make sure that happens).
  * Only tag with <code>Actors.SpellsForceAdd</code> if the mod is reading spells that previously in the LO had been removed (i.e. MMMforOOO.esp or FCOM_Convergence.esp).

=== Import Cells
* Allows certain changes to cell to be imported from source mods.
* __Configuration__
  * Source mods ~~must~~ contain one or more of the following bash [[#BashTags|tags]].
    * C.Climate: Mod changes cell climate.
    * C.Light: Mod changes cell lighting and/or fog.
    * C.Music: Mod changes cell music type.
    * C.Name: Mod changes cell names.
    * C.Owner: Mod changes cell ownership.
    * C.RecordFlags: Mod changes the dangerous/off limits flag on the cell.
    * C.Water: Mod changes cell water type/level.
* __Usage__
  * For selected mods, each of that tags will import the related information into the Bashed Patch if necessary.
  * In case two source mods modify the same cell in the same way, then the later loading source mod will win. If they modify the same cell in different ways (e.g. one changes water, the other changes ownership), then both changes will be included in the patch.

=== Import Factions
* Allows factions to be imported from source mods and/or source csv files.
* __Configuration:__
  * Source mods are automatically recognized if they have a <code>Factions</code> [[#BashTags|tag]] in the mod description.
  * Source text files are automatically recognized if they are in the <code>Oblivion\Data\Bash Patches</code> directory and end with <code>Factions.csv</code>. Note that the [[#ExportImportFactions|Export Factions]] command will export files in this format.
* __Source CSV Files__
  * To get source csv files, export factions from an existing mod. This can then be edited as desired.
  * Editor ids are shown for convenience only. Internally, it's the mod/object index pair that determines both the actor and the faction.
  * Faction lists do not need to be complete for each actor. I.e. you only need to list the actor/faction pairs that you wish to add/change. If a mod has an actor assigned to some faction, but the imported data doesn't address that rank, then the actor will retain that rank.
  * To remove an actor from a faction, set their rank to -1. (You can only do this in a spreadsheet.)
* __Limitation__
  * It should be kept in mind that changes to NPC factions will **not** have an effect in game for any NPCs that have had their faction ranks changed during gameplay. (This is typically fairly limited -- usually only for some quest characters.)

=== Import Graphics
* __Overview__
. Most graphics replacers work by replacing textures and meshes. However, sometimes such replacers are done by modifying the mod to point to different meshes and/or textures than the original mod. This is often done when vanilla Oblivion only offers a few simple meshes for a large number of objects, while the replacer aims to diversify the graphics for those objects (e.g. Phoenix Amon's [[http://www.tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=5570|Book Jackets]] mod). This patcher resolves this by extracting graphics components from specified mods and merging them into other changes to the same records.
* __Configuration:__
  * Source mods are automatically recognized if they have a <code>Graphics</code> [[#BashTags|tag]] in the mod description.
* __Graphics/Records Handled:__
. Only the following types of records are handled. Other types do not commonly require patching, or are not yet supported by Bash.
  * Icons only: birthsigns, loadscreens, region, land texture (probably actually the texture)
  * Models only: activators, doors, plants, furniture, grass, statics.
  * Icons and Models: potions, ammo, apparatus, books, ingredients, keys, misc., sigil stones, soul gems, weapons, clothing, armor, tree (icon probably is texture).
  * Creatures: model, body parts, blood.
  * Magic Effects: icon, model, shader, effects, light.
  * Effect Shaders: particle texture, fill texture

=== Import Inventory
* This option will merge changes to npc, container and creature inventories from the selected mods. Only mods marked with the <code>Invent</code> or <code>InventOnly</code> [[#BashTags|tag]] will appear in the list.
* __Invent vs. InventOnly__
  * "InventOnly" is a hack -- i.e. "a quick job that produces what is needed, but not well." It's there to support Vacuity's Item Interchange and that's pretty much it. It probably should not be used except for Item Interchange or a mod very much like II. Ideally, it should be separated into two tags: Invent,IIHack -- where it would still be hack, but at least a more clearly labelled hack.
  * InventOnly basically does Invent, but also does
  * Invent
  * Sometimes it's desirable to change only the inventory of an actor or container. This is desirable when modifying the inventory of creatures that have been changed by overhauls -- especially when you can't rely on the overhauls being present.
  * For a mod to override only the inventory, the mod must be tagged with <code>InventOnly</code> and must be merged into the patch (i.e. the mod must ~~not~~ be active when the patch is being built.)
* __Notes__
  * This feature is primarily concerned with removing, replacing and adding completely new items to inventories. If a mod only changes the number of items in an inventory, then this feature will ignore that change.
  * Generally later loading source mods will dominate.
    * If an early source adds two daedric arrows, while a later source adds three daedric arrows, then the patch will contain three daedric arrows.
    * If an early source replaces a steel sword with steel dagger, but a later source replaces the steel sword with an daedric dagger; then the patch will have the daedric dagger but ~~not~~ the steel dagger.
    * If a source tries to remove anything, but fails because that item is already present or a later mod has already removed it, then none of the changes from the source will be applied.

=== Import NPC Faces
* __Overview__
. This patcher component will extract the face, hair and eyes data from an NPC face modifying mod (which is to say any/all of the [[http://www.dreamingthepyramid.net/TNR-home.html|Tamriel NPCs Revamped mods]]), and add it to the patch, merging it over any changes to those same NPCs from other mods.
* __Configuration__
  * Source mods are automatically recognized if their mod name starts with __TNR __ or the mod has a <code>NpcFaces</code> or <code>NpcFacesForceFullImport</code> or <code>Npc.EyesOnly</code> or <code>Npc.HairOnly</code>[[#BashTags|tag]] in the mod description.
  * Note that since there is a now a [[http://www.dreamingthepyramid.net/misc/tnrallracesfinal.zip|TNR All Races]] mod, you may wish to discard (or at least uncheck) any previous TNR mods you have.
  * If tagged with NpcFaces only changed face subrecords will be imported into the patch; this will get changes from more esps at once - like hair from mod 1 and facial changes from mod 2 however depending on the exact changes the results may not __look__ good though.
  * If tagged with Npc.EyesOnly will import only eye changes. (Can be used with Npc.HairOnly if desired).
  * If tagged with Npc.HairOnly will import only hair changes. (Can be used with Npc.EyesOnly if desired).
  * If tagged with NpcFacesForceFullImport all the npc facial subrecords will be imported whether they are changed or not.
* __Source Mods__
  * Since TNR contains ~~only~~ face patches, and since the faces are entirely copied to the patch file, you can unload the source TNR mods -- but ~~do~~ keep them in your data directory, since Bash will need to find them when updating the patch.

=== Import Names
* __Overview__
. This component is intended to merge changes from a renamer mod or file into other mods. It can also handle localization of foreign language mods.
* __Configuration:__
  * Source mods are automatically recognized if they have a <code>Names</code> [[#BashTags|tag]] in the mod description.
  * Source text files are automatically recognized if they are in the <code>Oblivion\Data\Bash Patches</code> directory and end with <code>Names.csv</code>. Note that the [[#|Export/Import Names]] command will export files in this format.
* __Limitations:__
  * Handles most named objects types (except lights). Does **not** handle GMSTs, cells, landmarks or dialogs. If source mods is fully covered (no GMSTs, cells, etc.) then it does not need to be loaded after merging.
* __Guard Names__
  * A names patcher file that covers guards, legion soldiers, couriers, and a few other generically named characters and creatures from both Oblivion and Oscuro's Oblivion Overhaul.
;  * This is based on [[http://planetelderscrolls.gamespy.com/View.php?view=OblivionMods.Detail&amp;id=123| Flak's Complete Names Project]]. However, ranks have been strongly tweaked from Flak's version and OOO names have been added.
* ___OOO Potion Names__
  * A names patcher file that renames the alcoholic beverages back to vanilla names for those that don't like OOO's method of renaming them.
* __Random NPC Names/Random NPC Alternate Names__
  * A names patcher file that names/renames NPCs etc. in specified mods.
  * Supports/Authors: Crowded Roads Revamped ~ Spotty42, Crowded Roads Revisited ~ Smooth, Tamriel Travellers ~ Gratis_monsta, Crowded Cities 15/30 ~ Gratis_monsta, PT_RoamingNPCs ~ Gratis_monsta. (Will work for any combination of one or more of those - does not require them all).
* __Rational Names__
  * A names patcher file for Rational Names is included. This includes all of the name changes of the Rational Names 2 mod (but not the GMST settings for soul gem strings). It also includes additional name changes to cover Shivering Isles, Oscuro's Oblivion Overhaul and a few more mods.
  * Note that it is best not to edit this file directly since it is included in the Bash distribution. Instead, duplicate and edit as desired.

=== Import Relations
* Allows faction relation(ship)s to be imported from source mods and/or source csv files.
* __Configuration:__
  * Source mods are automatically recognized if they have a <code>Relations</code> [[#BashTags|tag]] in the mod description.
  * Source text files are automatically recognized if they are in the <code>Oblivion\Data\Bash Patches</code> directory and end with <code>Relations.csv</code>. Note that the [[#ExportImportRelations|Export Relations]] command will export files in this format.
* __Source CSV Files__
  * To get source csv files, export relations from an existing mod. This can then be edited as desired.
  * Editor ids are shown for convenience only. Internally, it's the mod/object index pair that determines both the actor and the faction.
  * Relation lists do not need to be complete for each faction. I.e. you only need to list the main/other pairs that you wish to add/change.
* __Limitation__
  * It should be kept in mind that changes to faction relationships will **not** have an effect in game for any factions that have had any of their relations changed during game play (through either the modFactionReaction or setFactionReaction command.) However, most factions are not altered in this way.

=== Import Roads
* __Overview__
  * Road records are used by some world spaces (e.g. Tamriel) to help guide NPCs who are traveling for long distances through that world. Very few mods modify road records, but if it is desired for the road from an earlier loading mod to override the road from a later loading mod, Import Roads can make that happen.
* __Configuration:__
  * Source mods are automatically recognized if they have a <code>Roads</code> [[#BashTags|tag]] in the mod description.

=== Import Scripts Contents
* __Overview__
  * Designed really to import the script subrecord of Dialogue records but not working for that yet, works fine for regular scripts currently. As of Wrye Bash version 278 no longer bringing script records forward if they are identical to the master record.
* __Configuration:__
  * Source mods are automatically recognized if they have a <code>ScriptContents</code> [[#BashTags|tag]] in the mod description.
* __Script/Records Handled:__
  * all script TopGroup records - but not the script segments of dialogues/quest stages (yet).

=== Import Scripts
* __Overview__
  * There are a fair number of mods that change the scripts on items and they often got blocked by the overhauls or cause compatibility problems. This fixes it so only the script change gets brought forward (and non-conflicting data). As of Wrye Bash version 278 no longer bringing script records forward if they are identical to the master record.
* __Configuration:__
  * Source mods are automatically recognized if they have a <code>Scripts</code> [[#BashTags|tag]] in the mod description.
* __Script/Records Handled:__
  * all editor object except spells and quests

=== Import Sounds
* __Overview__
  * There are not many mods that modify the sounds of existing records, but there are a few mods that tweak the sounds of magic effects (e.g. to silence them). Since magic effect records tend to modified for other reasons as well, other changes to the same records will wipe out the changes to sounds. This patcher component allows you to make sure that changes to the sounds of spells are included in the final version of the record.
* __Configuration:__
  * Source mods are automatically recognized if they have a <code>Sound</code> [[#BashTags|tag]] in the mod description.
* __Sound/Records Handled:__
. Only the following types of records are handled.
  * Magic Effects: casting, bolt, area and hit sounds.
  * Activators, Lights, Weather: sounds
  * Containers: Open and close sounds
  * Doors: Open, close and loop sounds.

=== Import Spell Stats
* __Overview__
  * This patcher can be used to modify spell stats according to specified mods and/or spreadsheet files.
  * One use for this is to make sure that spell stats from one early loading mod are not overridden by a later loading mod.
  * Another use is patch random spell mods to fit the spell balancing system specified by one of the overhaul mods. For this use the best approach is to supply a single spreadsheet which rebalances spells of many mods to fit a given overhaul. When using such a file, Bash will only apply stats for mods that are currently active and ignore the rest.
  * Source spreadsheets can be generated by using the [[#|Export/Import Spell Stats]] command.
* __Configuration:__
  * Source mods are automatically recognized if they have a <code>SpellStats</code> [[#BashTags|tag]] in the mod description.
  * Source text files are automatically recognized if they are in the <code>Oblivion\Data\Bash Patches</code> directory and end with <code>Spells.csv</code>. Note that the [[#|Export/Import Spell Stats]] command will export files in this format.

=== Import Stats
* __Overview__
  * This patcher can be used to modify ammo, apparatus, armor, book, clothing, ingredient, key, light, misc object, sigil stone, soulgem  and weapon stats according to specified mods and/or spreadsheet files.
  * One use for this is to make sure that weapon stats from one early loading mod are not overridden by a later loading mod.
  * Another use is patch random armor and weapon mods to fit the equipment balancing system specified by one of the overhaul mods. For this use the best approach is to supply a single spreadsheet which rebalances weapons of many mods to fit a given overhaul. When using such a file, Bash will only apply stats for mods that are currently active and ignore the rest.
  * Source spreadsheets can be generated by using the [[#|Export/Import Stats]] command.
* __Configuration:__
  * Source mods are automatically recognized if they have a <code>Stats</code> [[#BashTags|tag]] in the mod description.
  * Source text files are automatically recognized if they are in the <code>Oblivion\Data\Bash Patches</code> directory and end with <code>Stats.csv</code>. Note that the [[#|Export/Import Stats]] command will export files in this format.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
__Tweakers__ tweak records in the currently active set of mods in specified ways. All tweakers have several specific features which can be individually turned off. Features whose name ends with bracketed text (e.g., "Max Potion Weight [0.1]) can be configured by right clicking on the feature and selecting an option from the popup menu.

=== Globals
* Tweaks the values of globals to whatever is selected. Item ending with a "[xxx]" will allow you to choose a different value. Right click on the item and choose the preferred value from the list. Note: Any globals will only be added to the patch if there is an active mod file (including oblivion.esm) that includes one named the same (although case insensitive).
* __Crime: Force Jail:__ The bounty value you must have to have a jail term be non-optional (i.e. can't pay the fine).
* __Thieves Guild: Quest Attacking Penalty:__ Sets the penalty cost for attacking while completing a Thieves Guild Quest
* __Thieves Guild: Quest Killing Penalty:__ Sets the penalty cost for killing while completing a Thieves Guild Quest
* __Thieves Guild: Quest Stealing Penalty:__ Sets the penalty cost for stealing while completing a Thieves Guild Quest
* __Timescale:__ Oblivion's timescale.

=== Tweak Actors
* Changes to NPC or Creature record subrecords; such as skeleton.
* __As Intended: Boars__
  * Adds the Bethesda Boar Resistances spells to all boars (found by the UOP team, based off of a mod made by Tejon).
* __As Intended: Imps__
  * Adds the Bethesda Imp Resistances spells to imps (found by the UOP team, based off of a mod made by Tejon). May choose to apply to all imps, only full size imps, or only implings.
* __Bigger Nords and Orcs__
  * Adjusts the Orc and Nord race records to be taller/heavier - to be more lore friendly. Three choices available - MMM settings, RBP settings or standalone Bigger Nords and Orcs settings.
* __Irresponsible Creatures__
  * Sets responsibility to 0 for all/specified creatures - so they can't report you for crimes.
* __Mayu's Animation Overhaul Skeleton Tweaker__
  * Sets NPC skeletons paths to match that required for MAO to work. REQUIRES Mayu's Animation Overhaul or it will almost certainly cause CTDs.
* __No Bloody Creatures__
  * Nulls the blood records of all creatures; acts like 'Mart's Monster Mod - No Blood.esp' except universal and doesn't work with MMM (MMM uses a different system - won't cause any harm if used with MMM just will have pretty much no effect).
* __Quiet Feet__
  * Removes all/some 'foot' sounds from creatures; on some computers can have a significant performance boost.
* __Real Walk for female NPCs__
  * Changes all female NPCs to use Mur Zuk's Real Walk - Requires Mur Zuk's Real Walk animation file.
* __Redguard FGTS Nuller__
  * Sets Redguard NPC FGTS subrecords to null; for use with Better Redguards.
* __Sexy Walk for female NPCs__
  * Changes all female NPCs to use Mur Zuk's Sexy Walk - Requires Mur Zuk's Sexy Walk animation file.
* __VadersApp's Oblivion Real Bodies Skeleton Tweaker__
  * Changes all (modded and vanilla) NPCs to use diverse skeletons for different look. Not compatible with MAO, Requires VadersApp's Oblivion Real Bodies.
* __Vanilla Beast Skelton Tweaker__
  * Sets any NPCs using the vanilla non-beast skeleton path (skeleton.nif) to use the beast skeleton patch (skeletonbeast.nif). This avoids bugs when a mod changes the race of an NPC to a beast race without setting the skeleton path to the beast path, in which case the tail will appear to extend forever and weird stuff like that.

=== Tweak Assorted
* Assorted Tweaks...
* __All Armor/Clothing Playable__
  * Modifies non-playable armor/clothing to make them playable
  * If the non-playable armor/clothing satisfies one of the following conditions, it will not be made playable:
    * It is unnamed
    * It is scripted
    * It contains any of the case insensitive words:
      * "mark"
      * "token"
      * "willful"
      * Both "see" and "me" (as in "shouldn't see me")
      * "werewolf"
      * "no wings"
      * "tsaesci tail"
      * "widget"
    * It has no body flags set other than right ring
* __Armor/Clothing Shows Amulets/Rings__
  * Modifies playable armor/clothing to prevent hiding of amulets/rings.
* __Bow Reach Fix__
  * Some of the bows in Oblivion (and a few in user mods) have a reach of zero. Due to a bug in the Oblivion engine, if these bows are equipped by an NPC, the game will crash. This patch changes bows with zero reach to have reach == 1. (Note this is also fixed for vanilla Oblivion by the Unofficial Oblivion Patch.  However, Shivering Isles introduces more bows with the same problem.)
* __Darnified Books__
  * Tweak book coloring and font for use with Darnified UI.
  * Wtxt formatting (applied if first line looks like <code>== title ==</code>
    * &lt;&lt; or ^^ or &gt;&gt; at beginning of line generates a div align=xxx tag. (&lt;&lt;: left, ^^: center and &gt;&gt; right).
    * <code>== Text ==</code>: Generates a level 2 header..
    * <code>=== Text</code>: Generates a level 3 header.
    * Double underscores generates emphasized (strong color) text.
    * Double asterisks, double tildes have same effect as double underscores.
* __Default Icons__
  * Sets a default icon for any records that don't have any icon assigned"
* __Faction crime Gold Multiplier Fix__
  * Fix factions with unset crimeGoldMultiplier to have a crimeGoldMultiplier of 1.0. (The effect of this is not 100% known but it *might* avoid bugs -- at the least it'll make Tes4Edit happy.)
* __Harvest Chance__
  * Sets the harvest chance of all flora to the desired chance.
* __No Wind__
  * Sets wind speed for all weathers to 0; this means that bushes and trees don't move in the wind since there isn't any. May help on machines with low end graphic cards.
* __Reweigh: Arrows__
  * Like Reweigh: Potions, but caps the weight of arrows.
* __Reweigh: Ingredients__
  * Like Reweigh: Potions, but caps the weight of ingredients.
* __Reweigh: Potions (maximum)__
  * Potions in Oblivion are rather heavy by default. This changes the weight of potions to a specified value (0.1 up to 0.8). Note: this does not affect potions with script effects or with current weight >= 1.0. Thus it should not affect alcoholic beverages or scripted "potions" like HTS water skins.
  . Note that this is similar, but not the same as the [[#|Reweigh Potions]] command for savegames, which reweighs ~~user created~~ potions rather than mod created potions.
* __Reweigh: Potions (minimum)__
  * Reweighs potions to a minimum weight.
* __Reweigh: Staffs__
  * Like Reweigh: Potions, but caps the weight of staffs.
* __No Light Flicker__
  * Turns off flickering effects for lights. May help on machines with low end graphic cards.
* __No Light Fade Value Fix__
  * Sets the fade values on all lights to a default of 1.0 if not already set. (The effect of this is not 100% known but it *might* avoid bugs -- at the least it'll make Tes4Edit happy.)
* __Number of uses for pre-enchanted weapons and staffs__
  * The charge amount and cast cost will be edited so that all enchanted weapons and staffs have the amount of uses specified. Cost will be rounded up to 1 (unless set to unlimited) so number of uses may not exactly match for all weapons.'
* __Nvidia Fog Fix__
  * Ensures that cells have at least one non-zero fog value. For avoiding the Nvidia fog-related black screen.
  * This feature is based on Quarn's [[http://planetelderscrolls.gamespy.com/View.php?view=oblivionmods.detail&amp;id=2859|Nvidia Black Screen Fix]].
* __Right Hand Rings__
  * Makes rings behave more consistently by making all rings prefer to be on the right hand.
  * With this tweak activated, rings will only equip to the left hand if the right hand has a ring, but the left hand does not. You can use this to **make one ring permanently equipped** -- just equip it to the left hand and it will stay on until you specifically unequip it.
* __Magic: Script Effect Silencer__
  * Script Effect will be silenced and have no graphics.
* __Set Sound Attenuation Levels:__
  * The sound attenution levels will be set to tweak%*current level, thereby increasing (or decreasing) the sound volume (lower attenuation = higher volume).
* __Set Sound Attenuation Levels: Nirnroots Only__
  * The sound attenuation levels will be set to tweak%*current level, thereby increasing (or decreasing) the sound volume (lower attenuation = higher volume). This one only affects Nirnroots.
* __Skyrim-style Weapons:__
  * Sets all one handed weapons as blades, two handed weapons as blunt.

=== Tweak Clothes
* __Overview:__ This allows you tweak clothes in several ways. Note that some of these have are not recommended for reasons stated -- however your tastes may vary.
* __Gloves Show Rings:__ Prevents gloves from hiding rings.
* __Max Weight XXX:__ Many clothes items are too heavy in Oblivion. These options force them to lower weights (as specified). Right click on item to choose maximum weight allowed.
* __Robes Show Amulets:__  Forces all robes to show amulets. Not totally realistic, but looks cooler!
* __Robes Show Pants:__  Allows you to wear pants/skirts/greaves with robes. This is useful for armor and enchantment. ~~Not recommended~~ because graphics clipping is common.
* __Unlimited Amulets:__  Allows you to wear an unlimited number of amulets. ~~Not recommended~~ because it is unbalancing and it prevents amulets from displaying (i.e., they won't appear around your or NPC's necks).
* __Unlimited Rings:__  Same thing for rings.

=== Tweak Names
* Tweaks names of items and spells to make them sort more easily in inventory. For each type of item you can select the format to be used.
* __Body Part Codes:__ This determines what code will be used for tweaking armor and clothes covering various body parts. There are two versions.
  * Each code letter is assigned in order to: Amulets, Rings, Gloves, Helmets, Tail items, Robes (upper+lower body), Chest, Pants/Greaves, Boots/Shoes, Shields.
  * ARGHTCCPBS: Assigns codes to match part covered.
  * ABGHINOPSL: Assigns codes to sort more usefully. Amulets, then Rings, etc.
* __Armor:__ Choose format and whether you want armor rating to be shown.
* __Clothes:__ Choose format.
* __Lore Friendly Names: Dwarven->Dwemer:__ Changes nearly any usage of the word Dwarven to use Dwemer instead in order to better follow lore.
* __Notes and Scrolls:__ Choose format and whether you want enchanted scrolls at top (~) or bottom (.) of list. (Note that "~" will not display in inventory.)
* __Potions:__ Choose format.
* __Proper English Names: Staffs -> Staves:__ renames any instances of staffs to staves.
* __Proper English Names: Dwarfs -> Dwarves:__ renames any instances of dwaffs totaves
* __Spells:__ Chose format. You can choose whether you wish the school (e.g. D) and spell level (e.g. D2) to show.
  * If you're already using Supreme Magicka or similar spell namer, their label will be overwritten.
  * If you only want to remove existing labels, then use the No Label option ("Fire Ball").
* __Weapons:__ Choose format and whether you want damage to be shown.

=== Tweak Settings
* __Overview__
. Allows you to tweak game behavior in miscellaneous ways. Item ending with a "[xxx]" will allow you to choose a different value. Right click on the item and choose the preferred value from the list.
* __Actor Strength Encumbrance Multiplier:__ Actor strength X this multiplier = actor encumbrance capacity.
* __AI: Max Active Actors:__ The maximum number of actors for AI to be processing at once - must be higher than __Combat: Max Actors:__.
* __AI: Max Dead Actors:__ The maximum number of dead actors allowed before Oblivion begins to remove them.
* __AI: Max Smile Distance:__ Maximum distance for NPCs to start smiling.
* __Arrow: Litter Count/Time:__ Shot arrows will be automatically removed from the world after a certain period (Arrow Litter Time) or if their number exceeds the Arrow Litter Count.

* __Camera: Chase Tightness:__ Tightens up the 3rd person chase camera. Highest setting (x 3.0) essentially locks camera behind player.
* __Camera: PC Death Time:__ This is how long the camera lingers on the player after player's death before the reload menu appears. (Even at "Unlimited", you can hit escape to force reload menu to appear.)
* __Cell Respawn Time:__ Time that must pass after you've last visited a cell before the creatures, npcs and items in it respawn. Default is 3 days. Note that setting to longer durations will result in larger savegames.
* __Combat: Alchemy:__ By default, you cannot craft alchemy items in combat. Disallowing it encourages you to be ready for battle ahead of time.

* __Combat: Repair:__ By default, you cannot repair items in combat. Disallowing it encourages you to be ready for battle ahead of time.
* __Companions: Max Number:__ Sets the maximum number of companions that will follow the player.
* __Compass: Disable XXX:__ Disables POI's (Points of Interest), Quest Markers, or both on the compass.
  * Warning: Some quests may be hard to complete when quest markers are turned off (e.g., an early stage of Knights of the Nine).
  * Note: While this works with the vanilla interface, it appears to not work with some modifications of the UI. Problem might be changes to the marker icons, or it might be due to the POI recognition tweak.
* __Compass: POI Recognition:__ Distance at which Points of Interest become visible on the compass. Default is 12,000 units. Lowest setting (x 0.25) is just a little farther than unvisited locations will be "found." I.e., about a rock's throw. (No affect if POI visibility is turned off.)
* __Cost Multiplier: Enchantment:__ The cost multiplier factor for enchanting, OOO default: 120, vanilla default: 10.
* __Cost Multiplier: Recharge:__ The cost multiplier factor for recharging.

* __Leveled Item Max level difference:__ Maximum difference to player level for leveled items.
* __Magic: Bolt Speed:__ Speed at which at which magic bolts (projectiles) travel.
* __Magic: Chameleon Refraction:__ Turns off the refraction effect for chameleon, but leaves the incremental transparency effect on. (Transparency won't be very obvious until PC/NPC is at higher levels of Chameleon.)
* __Magic: Max NPC Summons:__ Sets the number of summons a NPC may have active at one time.
* __Magic: Max Player Summons:__ Sets the number of summons the player may have active at one time. Normally less than Max NPC Summons.

* __Warning: Interior Distance to Hostiles:__ For Interiors: sets the minimum distance a hostile actor has to be from the player to allow the player to sleep/fast travel/etc.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
__Special__ patch components don't fit into the categories above. Two of them ([[#|Alchemical Catalogs]] and [[#|Power Exhaustion]]) are for use with specific mods. The remaining component, [[#|Leveled Lists]], is for general use.

=== Cobl Catalogs
* __Overview__
. This patcher component will update the alchemical catalogs found in COBL (Common Oblivion). No configuration is required and the catalogs will not be produced unless __Cobl Main.esm__ is in the load list. The original catalogs list all ingredients found in Oblivion.esm. The update will add ingredients from all selected mods.

=== Cobl Exhaustion
* Requires Cobl 1.66 or higher.
* Converts powers into lesser powers, but imposes a (potentially fatal) penalty if they're used too frequently.
  * Assorted_Exhaust.csv: This patcher extends coverage to the Orrery and Shivering Isles powers.
  * Kmacg94_Exhaust.csv: This patcher (by Kmagc94) extends coverage to several more mods (bgBalancingEVCore, Consequences, Kenhanimal's Awesome Vampire Mod, Oblivion War Cry EV, Oscuro's Oblivion Overhaul, StartX Vanilla Vampires Revised, Vampire Hunter Tools, Vows and Covenants).
* Cobl's power exhaustion feature is intended as a replacement for Wrye's [[http://www.Wryemusings.com/Power%20Exhaustion.html|Power Exhaustion]] mod.

=== Content Checker
* When activated, this will check the inventory contents of containers, creatures and NPCs, and the entries of leveled lists to make sure that their entries are of valid types. E.g. it will try to ensure that leveled spell lists only contain spells and other leveled lists.
* If items/entries of incorrect type are found, then they are removed from the container/list. The patch report will list any containers/lists modified and what was removed from them.

=== Leveled Lists
* __Background__
  * When different mods alter the same leveled list, the last mod to load will "win" overriding any changes made by earlier loading mods. This is particularly a problem with creature and the various releveling mods which alter so many lists.
  * To overcome this, it is necessary to merge the changes to the various leveled lists into a new "merged list" mod, and ensure that this new mod loads after all the mods whose lists it merges.
* __List Merging__
  * During the scan process of the patch building, the list merger extracts leveled lists and merges them together. If mods only added items to leveled lists, this process would be simple. However, since mods often want to delete items from lists and/or relevel items in lists, it's often necessary to specify how the list merger will handle changes from specific mods. This specification is done through [[#|Bash Tags]] and/or manually configuring mods in the list merger dialog.
  * **Untagged Mods:** Mods that have no bash tags can only add new items to leveled lists. If a given item (e.g. an Iron Battle Axe is already present in the list (at any level or count), then no new entries for that item will be added. Also, if another mod has already marked that item as ~~removed~~ from the list, it will not be added.
  * **Delev Mods:** Mods that are tagged or configured as ~~Delev~~ mods can remove items from lists. Bash will figure out what to remove by comparing items in the mods version of the list to items added by its masters (Oblivion.esm, etc.). Any items that are present in the masters, but ~~not~~ in the Delev's list are marked as removed. Items marked this way will be removed from the list, and the removal will be remembered so that later mods won't re-add the item.
  * **Relev Mods:** Mods that are tagged or configured as ~~Relev~~ mods can break the previous rules. They can relevel an item that already exists in the list ("relevel" means change the levels and/or counts for the item in the list). Relev mods can also overrule a previous deletion. (However, delevs that run ~~after~~ the Relev will overrule the relev mod for the items they delete.
  * **Delev+Relev Mods:** A mod can be tagged/configured as both Delev and Relev. Doing this just combines the effects of the two separate tags.
* __Simple Guide to Tagging__
  * Generally, if a mod only ~~adds~~ items, then it should not be tagged.
  * If a mod needs to delete items from the original list, then it should be tagged as a ~~Delev~~ mod.
  * If a mod needs to change the levels of items that already exist in the list or reverse a previous deletion, then it should be tagged as a ~~Relev~~ mod.
  * To tag a mod, right click in the "Bash Tags" field at the bottom right of the Mods tab and check/uncheck tags as necessary. For more info, see [[#|Bash Tags]].
* __Configuration__
  * Generally it's best to set the bash tags correctly and leave the configuration on auto. However, it's also possible to manually configure delevelers/relevelers.
  * To add/remove mods from the list, uncheck Automatic and use the Add/Remove buttons.
  * To manually override the Delev/Relev tags for a given mod, right click on the mod name and check/uncheck states as necessary. To return to automatic setting, choose the "Auto" option instead.
* __[[http://devnull.sweetdanger.net/convergence/|FCOM]]__
  * FCOM (aka Kaboom, aka FraBOOOMMM) is a mod by dev_akm and others that attempts to merge the changes from various major mods. While this might seem to be competitive with Bash's List Merger, it's actually complementary, since it's able to intelligently merge complicated list structures as well as correct and merge faction information.
  * For further information on using FCOM with Bash, see the FCOM release notes/topics.
* __Empty Sublist Cleaning__
  * Lists occasionally contain empty sublists, which will cause the list to produce nothing when it selects the sublist.
  * As of Bash v 183, the leveled list merger will now remove any empty sublists from a leveled list.

=== Morph Factions
* This is only for users of the Wrye Morph mod 0.05 or higher. It requires Cobl 1.28 or higher.

=== Power Exhaustion
* __Overview:__
* Wrye's deprecated [[http://www.Wryemusings.com/Power%20Exhaustion.html|Power Exhaustion]] mod changes the greater powers in Vanilla (non-Shivering Isles) into lesser powers, but imposes a (potentially fatal) penalty if they're used too frequently.
* Replaced by Cobl Exhaustion

<a id="ImportRaceInfo"></a>
=== Race Records
* __Overview__
. This patcher component will extract the eyes and hair from the loaded source mods and, if necessary, merge that data over changes from later loading mods that change the same races. (Note that if the source mods are **not** in the load list, they will not be used.)
* __Configuration__
  * Source mods ~~must~~ contain one or more of the following bash [[#BashTags|tags]].
    * Body-F: If specifying female body textures.
    * Body-M: If specifying male body textures.
    * Body-Size-F: If specifying female height, or weight.
    * Body-Size-M: If specifying male height, or weight.
    * Eyes: If mod contributes eyes.
    * Hair: If contributing hair.
    * R.AddSpells: If adding racial spells.
    * R.Attributes-F If specifying race attributes for females.
    * R.Attributes-M: If specifying race attributes for males.
    * R.ChangeSpells: If totally overwriting race spells list(s).
    * R.Description: If specifying race description(s).
    * R.Mouth: If specifying/changing mouth/tongue. (See [[http://www.tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=10674|Merged Mouth]].)
    * R.Relations: If specifying race relations.
    * R.Skills: If specifying race skill bonuses ([[#|Race Records]]).
    * R.Teeth: If specifying/changing upper/lower teeth. (See [[http://www.tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=10674|Merged Teeth]].)
    * Voice-F: If specifying female voice.
    * Voice-M: If specifying male voice.
    . E.g., for Beautiful People, the tag should be {{BASH:Hair,Eyes}}.
* __Merge Procedure__
  * Body: All body textures/mesh paths that aren't imported by a specific tag (ie R.Mouth)will be fairly intelligently merged by the Body-F/M tag. Does a mainly intelligent merge of the attributes. Note that "body" includes: body textures, **Changed in Wrye Bash 292:** height and weight are imported with the Body-Size-F/M tags.
  * Hair: All hairs will be merged into final record.
  * Eyes: All eyes will first be merged, then filtered by eye mesh to avoid googly eyes (see below).
  * Relations: All relations will be merged into final record. Procedure is pretty much the same as for [[#ImportRelations|importing faction relations]].
  * Voice: The last mod tagged with Voice-M (Voice-F) will win for males (females). This tag is useful for (the very few) mods which replace/change default voices.
* __Avoiding Googly Eyes__
  * "Googly eyes" happens when an eye texture built for one eye mesh is used in combination with a different eye mesh. In vanilla Oblivion, this never happens because all races use the same eye meshes. However, several of the cosmetics mods change the meshes for various races. When different cosmetics mods are mixed or (sometimes) when custom races are used, this can result in at least some eyes for a given race being mismatched to the eye mesh for that race.
  * As of version 104, Bash will try to prevent this sort of eye texture/mesh mis-matching. Unfortunately, Bash cannot guarantee success in all cases.
  * Some suggestions for modders:
    * When adding a custom race, use either only vanilla eyes, or only custom eyes. I.e. do not mix custom eyes and vanilla eyes. If you mix vanilla eyes and custom eyes, and if the race is playable, then bash will filter down to just the vanilla eyes.
    * When creating a cosmetics mod, do **not** replace the vanilla eye resource with a different eye mesh resource. Instead, create a new eye mesh resource and use that. Note: If you're using one of the standard alternative eye resources (e.g. Rens) then use the standard path for that. When bash does its filtering, it determines what eye mesh each eye is using, and then filters the eyes for a given race to so that only eyes using the same mesh will be used. This is why it's important for mesh resources to be consistent.
    * Unfortunately, one of the most popular race mods, Beautiful People, ~~does~~ replace the standard eye mesh resource. To resolve this, the Beautiful People installation will need to be patched. (Sorry, but I don't know if such a patch is available yet.)
* __Notes__
. Even if none of the source mods are selected, this patcher component will sort hairs and eyes as well as attempt to remove googly eyes from all active mods. It will also randomly assign hairs and eyes to npcs that are otherwise missing them.

=== SEWorld Tests
* Suspends Cyrodiil quests while in Shivering Isles.
* __Overview:__
  * Shivering Isle modifies almost all existing quests in Oblivion.esm to add an additional test: GetPlayerInSEWorld == 0. The effect of this test is to suspend almost all Cyrodiilian quests while the player is in Shivering Isles.
  * Unfortunately mods that are built on top of the original Oblivion.esm do not include this test. This can sometimes result  in strange behavior: SI residents talking about Cyrodiilian topics, etc.
  * This feature simply reinstates those tests where mods have removed them.

== Doc Browser ============================================================
* You can easily and quickly scan through your mods document files (read me's) from the Doc Browser window. Supported doc types: text files, html and mht (html archives).
* To show the Doc Browser window, go to the Mods Tab and double click on any mod in the main list.

=== Using the Doc Browser
<img src="bash/images/WryeBash_DocBrowser.png" width="787" height="500" style="border: 0;"  alt="tool image"></img>
* When you the Doc Browser is showing and you click on the name of a Mod in the Mods Tab, Bash will try to show the document for that mod in the Doc Browser window. If Bash does not know which document to associate with the mod, it will show a blank page.
* To associate a document with a mod:
  * Select the mod in the Mods Tab.
  * Switch to the Doc Browser and click on "Set Doc..." and use the file dialog to find the document.
* To disassociate a document with a mod:
  * Use "Set Doc..." again to pick a different doc. **Or...**
  * Use "Forget Doc..."
* To change the name of a document, click on the "Rename Doc..." button, and use the file dialog to pick a new name/location. The document will be renamed and/or moved to the new directory.
* To view a different document:
  * Select the document on the Mods tab. **Or...**
  * Use the mod name list box to select the desired mod.
* To make a text document editable, click the "Edit Doc..." button.
  * Note that editable docs will stay editable until you unset "Edit Doc...".
  * Also the Edit doc setting is remembered separately for each mod. As you switch between mods, the "Edit Doc..." button will return to the remembered state for that document.
  * Any changes to the document will be automatically saved when the mod is changed, the document window is closed or the edit button is unclicked.
  * To create a new document, just use "Set Doc..." and pick a file name that doesn't exist yet. This will give you a blank document template - and any changes to it will save automatically, creating the new file.
* To open text doc in external editor:
  * Click "Open Doc..."

=== Wiki Text Format
* If the mod's doc file is a __.txt__ file in Wrye wiki text format, an html version of it will be automatically generated as needed, and this html version will be shown when the doc Browser is not in edit mode.
* **Format Documentation and Template:**
  * The wiki text format is documented in __Data\Docs\Bash Readme Template.txt__.
  * When you create a new readme document (by using "Set Doc..." to a file that doesn't exist yet), you'll be given a template wiki text file. The template used will either be the template above, or __Data Files\Docs\My Readme Template.txt__ if it exists.

=== Notes
* If you rename a mod in the mods tab, Bash will move the document association to the new name.
* Similarly, if you copy a mod, the new copy will be associated with the same document.
* Documents can be stored in different directories.
* If you ~~delete~~ a mod, then Bash will forget about its document (but won't delete it). However, if you ~~Hide~~ a mod, Bash will remember the document, and you'll still be able to select it from the Doc Browser's mod name list box.

=== Suggestions
* You may want to move your docs from the Data directory to a new Data\Docs directory. This will reduce clutter somewhat and make documents easier to find.

== Mod Checker ================================================================
The Mod Checker allows you to run a check of your active and [[#MergePatches|merged]] mods. The resulting report will recap configurations, make suggestions and list warnings. You can run the Mod Checker by clicking the Mod Checker button in the toolbar at the bottom of the main window.

=== Generic Information
At the top of the report are generic warnings.
* __Missing Master:__ A note like this indicates that an active mod has a master that should be active, but is not. This sort of problem will result in an immediate CTD while trying to launch the game.
* __Delinquent Master:__ This warning indicates that a mod depends on a master that is set to load ~~after~~ the mod itself. This won't necessarily result in a problem, but it's best to fix it anyway (by reordering mods).
* __Version Info:__ In the mod list (if active) mods will display version strings after their name if Bash can find version info (basically anything along the lines of rev 1.2c or version 1.3 or v.12Alpha1) in the esp/m header description.

=== Ruleset Information
The rest of the report is divided into rulesets reports. Rulesets are text files provided by modders and other modders and other players. They basically tell Bash's mod checker which things to look out for and what to say about them in the Mod Checker report.
* Rulesets are plain text file stored in the Oblivion\Data\Bash Patches directory. Any file in this directory that ends in "Rules.txt" will be assumed to be a ruleset and included in the report.
* Rulesets can be edited while bash is running. Edit ruleset as desired and regenerate (update) the report. Bash will recognize the changed ruleset and reload it before it re-generates the report.
* For more info on ruleset syntax, see [[http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Tes4Mod:Wrye_Bash/Mod_Checker|UESP: Wrye Bash Mod Checker]].

=== Only One Warnings
These warnings may appear the top of the ruleset report. Such warnings are followed by a list of active/merged esps. These are typically are conflicting mods that do almost the same thing. You can resolve this by deactivating all but one of the listed mods.

=== Mod Group Info
The rest of the report is divided into mod groups, where "mod groups" are sets of one or more active/merged mods. Each such group can have several subsections:
* __Notes:__
  * Various notes for the mod group.
* __Configuration:__
  * This is just a recap of the configuration of a mod group.
  * You'll typically see this for large mods with many separate esp files. It just provides an easy way to review what you do and don't have active.
  * Legend: x: active; +: merged; *: imported; -: inactive/unmerged.
* __Suggestions:__
  * This will be followed by specific suggestions for the mod group. Typically these will involved activating or deactivating existing mods (and possibly replacing them with different mods).
* __Warning:__
  * This has same format as suggestions. Problem mods will be listed along with instructions to activate them or deactivate them as need be.

=== Mod Checker Options
* __Mod List:__ Toggles mod list in the report.
* __Rule Sets:__ Toggles inclusion of all the mod rule group info including headers.
* __Notes:__ Toggles inclusion of mod group notes.
* __Configuration:__ Toggles inclusion of mod group configuration info.
* __Suggestions:__ Toggles inclusion of mod group suggestions.
* __Version Numbers:__ Toggles inclusion of version numbers for the mods in the mod list.
* __CRCs:__ Toggles inclusion of CRCs for the mods in the mod list.
* __Scan for UDR's / Scan for Dirty Edits:__ Toggles scanning mod files for deleted references and Identical to Master records.  With CBash disabled, this can take quite some time.  ITM scanning will only occur if CBash is enabled, UDR scanning works in both CBash and non-CBash mode.
  * The number of ITM records reported by Wrye Bash will usually be a little less than when cleaned in TES4Edit, due to not checking GRUP records.
* __Copy Text:__ Copies text of report to clipboard. (Useful for forum postings.)
* __Update:__ The report will usually auto-regenerate (if necessary) when you raise the Mod Checker window. But if it doesn't you can force it to regenerate with this button.

== INI Edits Tab ==================================================================
<img src="bash/images/ini-oblivion.png" height="400" width="663" style="border: 1;" alt="INI Edits Tab" />
<img src="bash/images/ini-all natural.png" height="400" width="663" style="border: 1;" alt="INI Edits Tab" />
* This feature allows you to quickly modify an Ini file (such as Oblivion.ini) by copying settings from an Ini Tweak file. Ini tweak files are just like Oblivion.ini, except they contain ~~only~~ the section/key settings that are to be changed.
* Tweaks can also be applied to Ini files that contain scripts to configure mods.  These Ini tweak files are just like the script you're trying to tweak, except the contain ~~only~~ the settings that are to be changed.  Wrye Bash can modify any __set__ or __setGS__ commands in these script files.
* Clicking on a tweak will show its contents, along with the status of each specific tweak in it:
  * **[bg=#FFD5AA]Orange:[/bg]** The specific heading or tweak is invalid for the target ini.
  * **[bg=#FFFFBF]Yellow:[/bg]** The specific tweak is different than the current setting in the target ini.
  * **[bg=#C1FFC1]Green:[/bg]** The specific tweak matches what is in the target ini.
* Clicking on a line in the tweak file or the target ini will show show scroll the tweak file or target ini (as applicable) to the matching line.
* **Warning:** Incorrect Oblivion.ini settings can cause general weirdness, CTDs or even damage to your computer! (Or so I've heard.) Advanced graphics settings in particular tend to be card/computer specific and should not be casually copied from one computer to another.
* **Note:** The background load section of the ini file changed with the introduction of Patch 1.2. It would probably be a bad thing to apply pre 1.2 background settings to a 1.2 configuration and vice versa.
* __Checkbox Colors__
  * <img src="bash/images/checkbox_green_on.png" width="16" height="16" style="border: 0;" alt="Green with Check" /> <img src="bash/images/checkbox_green_imp.png" width="16" height="16" style="border: 0;" alt="Green with Dot" /> <img src="bash/images/checkbox_yellow_imp.png" width="16" height="16" style="border: 0;" alt="Yellow with Dot" /> <img src="bash/images/checkbox_green_off.png" width="16" height="16" style="border: 0;" alt="Green" /> <img src="bash/images/checkbox_orange_off.png" width="16" height="16" style="border: 0;" alt="Orange" />
  * Checkbox colors indicate the status of the ini tweak
    * <img src="bash/images/checkbox_orange_off.png" width="16" height="16" style="border: 0;" alt="Orange" />: Invalid; some or all variables set in the INI do not exist in the selected Ini file.
    * <img src="bash/images/checkbox_green_off.png" width="16" height="16" style="border: 0;" alt="Green" />: Valid; all values exist in the target Ini, but none of the settings are the same as in the tweak file
    * <img src="bash/images/checkbox_yellow_imp.png" width="16" height="16" style="border: 0;" alt="Yellow with Dot" />: Valid, some of the settings in target Ini are the same, but some are not.
    * <img src="bash/images/checkbox_green_imp.png" width="16" height="16" style="border: 0;" alt="Green with Dot" />: Valid, some of the settings in target Ini are the same, but some are not.  The ones that are not, ARE the same as another tweak file from the same installer.
    * <img src="bash/images/checkbox_green_on.png" width="16" height="16" style="border: 0;" alt="Green with Check" />: Valid and Active.

=== INI Tweaks Options
* The drop down selection box chooses your target Ini file for applying the tweaks to.
  * __Remove__: Removes the target Ini from the drop down selection box.
  * __Edit__: Opens the target Ini file for editing.
* __Valid Tweaks First:__ If checked, invalid tweaks will be sorted to the bottom.
* __Open:__ Opens the INI Tweaks directory.

=== Tweak File Commands
* __Apply:__ Applies the INI Tweak to Ovlivion.ini
* __Copy to new Tweak:__ Creates a new tweak file that tweaks the same settings as the selected file, but uses the values of the target INI instead of the selected tweak.
* __List Errors:__ If the tweak is invalid, this will show you which entries in the tweak don't exist in Oblivion.ini
* __Open:__ Open the tweak file for editing.
* __Delete:__ Delete the tweak file.

== Saves Tab ==================================================================
<img src="bash/images/WryeBash_04.png" width="686" height="527" style="border: 0;" alt="Saves Tab" />

=== Saves List
* __Checkbox Colors__
  * <img src="bash/images/checkbox_purple_on.png" width="16" height="16" style="border: 0;" alt="Purple" /> <img src="bash/images/checkbox_blue_on.png" width="16" height="16" style="border: 0;" alt="Blue" /> <img src="bash/images/checkbox_green_on.png" width="16" height="16" style="border: 0;" alt="Green" /> <img src="bash/images/checkbox_orange_on.png" width="16" height="16" style="border: 0;" alt="Orange" /> <img src="bash/images/checkbox_red_on.png" width="16" height="16" style="border: 0;" alt="Red" />
  * Checkbox colors indicate the "health" of the mod file's master files.
    * Purple: Good. Exactly synced with currently selected mods.
    * Blue: Good. Compatible with currently selected mods. However, current mod set includes some mods that are not used by this save game.
    * Green: Good, but not in sync with currently selected mods. Use [[#|Load Masters]] to sync load list to this save.
    * Orange: Some mods have changed order. Oblivion and TESCS will adjust for this when you load. However, if some of the mods that you depend made conflicting changes to the same item, a different mod may now dominate because of the reordering.
    * Red: A master is missing. You should check to make sure that you have not inadvertently renamed or removed the mod.

=== Backup Files
* When you autosave or quicksave, Oblivion backs up the previous version of the savefile (e.g. "autosave.ess" becomes "autosave.bak"). Bash includes these backup files in the Saves file listing. You can easily revert to any of these backup by renaming or duplicating the file to a new filename with extension "ess".
* You can also increase the number of backups kept by incrementing the ~~iSaveGameBackupCount~~ setting in the [[#|Oblivion.ini]] file.

=== Save Details
* Make changes to the file in the details view.
* __File Name:__ Change the file name.
* __Notes:__
  * Enter some info about the save.
  * This fields is useful for keeping track of what "Landmark" saves are about/for. E.g. a save just before or after making a major change in your load list or before/after completing some quest.
* __Masters List:__
  * The masters list show the esm files that the current mod depends on, and the load order (modIndex) of that master.
  * **Renaming Masters:** If a master has been renamed, you can adjust for that here by renaming the master. Either left-click the name and edit it in the column display, or right-click the name, select ~~Change To...~~ and then select the desired replacement esp/esm from the mods directory.
    * Note that you should ~~only~~ do this if the new name is a new version of the same mod. Replacing a mod with an unrelated mod will cause file corruption.
  * **Disabling Masters:** If you want to remove a mod from active use, you can usually just start playing without the mod loaded. However, this won't work if the mod is an esm. You can get around this by right clicking on the name and selecting ~~Disable~~. This will rename the master to a non-existent esp. Note that you still may run into logical errors which prevent the esm from being removed. But at least this way the game will ~~try~~ to run without the master.
* __O/P Flags__
  * These two flags may appear to the right of the player info. If present, they indicate that the corresponding CoSave file exists (O: .obse; P: .pluggy). CoSave files are extra files created by OBSE and Pluggy for storing addition information related to the savegame.

== Save Profiles ==============================================================
Save Profiles are "play environments", where the environment consists of a set of savegames plus the active set of mods. Typically, save profiles are used to allow easy and safe switching between different characters. Or they might be used for switching between different stages of a characters life. (E.g. you might use different profiles for before and after a major overhaul is a installed.)

__Notes:__
* Save Profiles make use of the <code>SLocalSavePath</code> setting in Oblivion.ini, which allows you to specify which directory savegames are found in. This means that once you've set the profile, you don't have to do anything special with Bash. I.e. the regular Oblivion launcher will recognize the selected profile.
* You can also associate different versions of Oblivion.esm with different save profiles, which means that when you switch profiles, you can automatically turn Shivering Isles content on or off. See [[#|Oblivion.esm Swapping]] for more info.

=== Create/Edit Profiles
* To create/modify save profiles:
  * Go to saves tab and right click on the "File" column header. This will give you a context menu.
  * Select Profile: Edit Profiles to get the edit dialog.
  * Use the add/rename/remove commands as desired.
  * You can enter information about the profile in the text field.
* To select a savegame profile:
  * Go to the context menu again and select Profile:[Name of profile].
* To view the save profile directory:
  * Go to context menu and select "Open...".

=== Moving Savegames
After creating a savegame, you may want to move some of your existing files to it. To do this, just select the files, right click and select __Move To:[destination profile]__. Note that this function will also move any cofiles (.pluggy) files associated with the savegame files.

== Save File Commands =========================================================
These are the commands found on context menu for saves...
* Same as for [[#FileCommands|Mods Tab: File Commands]] above.

=== Load Masters
* Synchronizes activated mods to savegame's masters.

=== List Masters (Save)
* Lists savegame masters in window **and** copies the list to the clipboard.
. This is useful for forum postings where you want help debugging your load list, or just want to show off how many mods you have loaded!
* Notes
  * List is in load order. (Unlike plugins.txt which is in alphabetical order.)
  * Version number of the mod is listed if it is present in the mod's description field and in the right format (e.g. <code>Version: 01.21</code>).

=== Diff Masters
* If two savegames are selected, then will compare masters of the new save to those of the older save.
* If one savegame is selected, then will compare currently active mods to masters of savegame.
* Report includes:
  * Removed Masters: Masters in older save that are not present in newer save (or currently active mod list).
  * Added Masters: Masters in newer save (or active mod list) that are not present in older save.

=== Statistics
* Reports various statistics for save file. Probably too technical for most people. Feel free to skip this section...
* Array Sizes
  * These are the sizes of the major arrays in the savegame.
  * Created Items are items created while playing -- e.g., spells, enchanted armor, clothing, weapons.
  * Records are records of changes to previously defined objects. E.g., removing the essential flag from an NPC.
  * FormIds is a table which maps an internal reference number to a [[http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Tes4Mod:FormId|formid number]]. Kind of technical, but what it comes down to is, if the savegame ever had to refer to a specific formid, then that formid shows up in this table. If the formid comes from a mod that is later removed from the game, then its entry in this table is replaced with a 0. (I refer to such an entry as a "lost ref" because it's lost its connection to the source mod.)
* Created Items
  * This shows the counts for the various types of items created in-game.
  * If there are lot of any one type (e.g., over 1000), then you likely have a older, buggy companion share mod which should be upgraded.
* FormIds
  * This is a breakdown of the FormId table by source mod.
* Record Details
  * Change record details are broken down by type and by mod. The type is number, which is followed by a description if known (e.g., "6 Faction").
* New ObjectRef Bases
  * New ObjectRefs are record type 49 change records that belong to the savegame itself. E.g., if you drop an arrow on the ground, there will be a new objectRef for that arrow that will belong to the savegame. Oblivion seems to delete these fairly well, but certain scripting techniques will cause them to stick around, and particularly bad techniques or bugs will cause a lot of them to stick around which can bloat the game and cause save/load problems.
  * The "Base" of an objectRef is the baseid of the object (e.g., the formid of a steel arrow from Oblivion.esm). The objectRef refers to these indirectly through an "iref". Usually this will map back to a formid, but if the original mod has been removed from the load order, then the formid is set to zero. If this has happened, then a count of such "Null Bases" will be shown.
  * After the "Null Base" count (if present) is a list of New ObjectRef Bases where the count is over 100 (e.g., if there are over 100 new arrows lying around). Show is the count, the iref and the base formid.
    * Formid == 0 is a "Null Base". An
    * Formid beginning with FF is reference to an object defined by the savegame.
    * Otherwise, the formid will map back to a mod. The first two digits are the modindex, and can be matched to a mod through the "MI" column in the list of savegame masters.

=== .OBSE Statistics
* Reports various statistics for cosave files (savename.pluggy and savename.obse). Probably too technical for most people. Feel free to skip this section...
* to be properly documented

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Delete Spells
* This allows you to remove unused spells from your spell list.
* **Warning:** Spells once removed cannot be re-added. While most spells can be repurchased, and custom spells can be recreated, quest and other spells may require use of the console to re-add.

=== Import Face
* See [[#|Face Import]] below.

=== Import NPC Levels
* **Deprecated.** Use [[#|Update NPC Levels]] instead.

=== Set Number of Uses for Weapon Enchantments
* This allows you to set the number of uses for any cast when used enchantments you have created in-game (or otherwise have ended up recorded in your save game).

=== Rename Enchanted
* This allows you to rename any enchanted items that you have created in-game.

=== Rename Potions
* This allows you to rename any potions that you have created in-game.

=== Rename Spells
* This allows you to rename any spells that you have created in-game.

=== Reweigh Potions
* Potions created in-game are given a weight that is somewhat arbitrarily selected and potentially high (over 1 lb per potion). (See: [[http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Alchemy#Weight|UESP: Oblivion Alchemy]].)
* You can use this command to set the weight for all of your created potions to specified value.
* Notes:
  * Effects ~~all current potions~~ -- and thus all future potions with the same name and effects.
  * Potions created after use of this command with a new name and/or different effects, and/or different durations of the same effects will not be affected. To change them, you'll need to rerun this command.
  * Suggested value: 0.1 to 0.3

=== Update NPC Levels
* __Background__
  * NPC levels determine how NPCs rank relative to the player, and are frequently tweaked by rebalancing mods (e.g. Oscuro's Oblivion Overhaul). However, because of the way the game engine stores level information for NPCs, such tweaks will not affect games that were started before the tweak mod was added to the load list. This command compensates for this by importing the tweaked NPC levels into the savegame.
* __Usage__
  * Make sure that mods that you want to play with are active, then select one or more save files and run the command. NPC level info will be read from all active mods and applied to all selected save files.
* __Notes__
  * This replaces the previous Import NPC Levels command. It's simpler to use, and can be applied to multiple save files at once.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=== Remove Bloat
* __Background:__ The Oblivion game engine keeps savegame file size down by **garbage collecting** various types of objects. Arrows shot into the game world will be removed after several minutes of gameplay, while most other types of objects dropped in cells will be removed if the cell is not visited for a period of three days. However, certain scripting approaches in mods can result in large number of objects being created in such a way that they are not garbage collected.
* __Excess Created Objects:__ A few older mods use scripting approaches that resulted in the duplication of existing objects as new "created in game" objects. (The major problem has been due to early companion sharing mods.) Prolonged use of such mods can result in 10's of thousands of newly created objects.
* __Null Refs:__ Null refs are one source of savegame bloating that is relatively easy to identify. Null refs are items dropped or placed in the game world that are instances of objects from a mod that has since been removed. (E.g. "Mega Awesome.esp" might add "Mega Awesome Swords" to bandits. If one of those is lying on the ground in some dungeon and then "Mega Awesome.esp" is removed, then the sword lying on the ground becomes a null ref.)
* __Usage:__
  * Run the __Remove Bloat__ command. This will either report that there's no bloating or will report suspected bloating numbers, and prompt you to continue to remove the bloating.
  * If you have bloating, then:
    * If the numbers are small (roughly under 200), then probably the best thing to do is to decline to remove bloating. Removing it won't make that much difference.
    * Figure out ~~why~~ you have bloating. Null Refs are fairly common if you've removed mods. However, large numbers of created objects indicates a problem with one of your installed mods (probably a companion and/or companions sharing mod). Such mods should be updated or removed.
    * Before removing, you should make sure that you have duplicate of the savegame. Savegame corruption might show up later. If the command has minimal result on savegame file size, then discard the modified file.
  * Again, keep in mind that this is an **experimental** command. While good results have been reported so far, it's possible that problems may appear later.

=== Repair Abomb
* Fixes "Abomb" animation slowing by resetting the TesClass Abomb counter to 0x41000000 (or float 8.0).
* "Abomb Animation Slowing" is a slowing a of animations that typically appears around 225 hours into the game (though it may occur earlier or later). Effects are that many animations (spell effects, burning fires, opening/closing doors) have noticeably stop action effects, even while the rest of the scene is rendered normally. In fact the problem is ~~worse~~ in areas with high frame rates (e.g., simple interiors). This is presumably a bug with the game engine, probably something with thread prioritization for animations.
* The trigger for animation slowing seems to be the last four bytes of the TesClass data chunk in the save file. These bytes apparently represent a float value, which increments steadily with game play (on my machine advancing at about 2/3 of game seconds played). When the counter crosses a certain threshold (0x49000000), the animation slowing kicks in suddenly. The fix seems to be to simply reset this counter to an early value (0.0 would probably work. I use 8.0 or 0x41000000).
* There have been some reports of related problems with animations (dying wraiths not dropping properly) and physics collisions. Also, some have reported problems showing up before 0x49000000. However, there is clearly a substantial change as the counter crosses 0x490000, and the reported physics problems have been seen earlier in the game and so may be unrelated.
* For more discussion see: [[http://forums.bethsoft.com/?showtopic=688265|ESForums: Slow/Frozen Doors]].

=== Repair Factions
* (Mostly) fixes empty faction bug introduced in Wrye Bash v 105 (with most people experiencing them starting at version 111 which introduced new [[#|Update NPC Levels]] function.
* Also (optionally) updates NPC factions to reflect faction changes in mods.
* __Background__
  * The v105 bug caused some NPCs in the savegame to be marked as having no factions and no spells. The most notable effect of this was faction infighting, however, another major effect (for people importing faces at the start of the game) was the removal of the player from the playerfaction (very bad!). A few other rare effects might happen -- e.g. the inhabitants of Alsewell might become invisible sooner than they should.
  * Unfortunately, it's not possible to remove the effects of the bug with total safety -- sometimes, NPCs should ~~need~~ to have zeroed spells and/or factions. (E.g., Aleswell again. If citizens have empty spell arrays removed ~~after~~ the quest has been completed, they'll disappear when they shouldn't.)
  * Aside from my bug, there are related problems with mods that are changed so as to ~~add~~ factions to NPCs after that NPC is already in play ~~and~~ has had its factions modified in-game. E.g. CM Partners that have been upgraded from v 1.4 to v 1.5.
* __Advice__
  * Do not use this function unless you have to! In general, **if you have a recent save that you can revert to, I'd advise you to use that instead!**
  * Check the log when you're done. If the results make your nervous, then do a File: Revert to Backup to return to pre-repair state.

=== Repair Fbomb
* The Repair Fbomb command has been removed since the problem has been fixed by Bethesda's 1.2.0416 patch. For more info, see [[http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Shivering:Reference_Bug#Repair | UESP: Reference Bug]].

=== Repair Hair
* Oblivion has a bug that will cause a crash if your PC's hair comes from a mod that has been removed and you then run showRaceMenu. One way to avoid this problem is to use Bash to import a face (thus also importing hair). Another solution is to use this command.
* Repair Hair will check to see if your PC's hair has become lost, and if so, replace it with the default hair for that race/gender.

== Face Import ================================================================
<img src="bash/images/WryeBash_03.png" width="667" height="499" style="border: 0;" alt="Face Import from Esp"></img>

=== Import to Save
* __Procedure__
  * Right click on savegame and select Import Face. This will result in a file dialog where you can select either another save, or a mod file. When you select a file, you'll get a dialog listing all characters whose face you can import.
    * For mod files, all NPCs in the mod will be listed.
    * For save files, the player character will always be at the top of the list. In addition some clones of the player (e.g. for statue in Bruma) and other npcs may also be listed. Usually, you'll want the player character.
  * Click on a face in the list to display its details (Name, Race, Gender, Stats). If the face has an image associated with it, the image will be displayed.
  * Use checkboxes to import additional characteristics.
  * Click the import button.
* __{{A:Stats Import}}__
  * When importing a face from a mod, you can choose to import the stats. ~~Use this with care and be aware of the limitations!~~
  * The stats seen in-game are combination of base npc stats for the pc plus magical modifiers plus scripted modifications. This command ~~only~~ affects the base npc stats, hence what you may see in game may be notably different. In particular:
    * Health = npcBaseHealth + gmstFactor*currentEndurance
    * Magicka = npcBaseMagicka + (1+gmstFactor)*currentIntelligence
    * Fatigue = npcBaseFatigue + gmstFactor*currentEndurance
  * It's possible that the change in base stats, combined with the scripted changes to stats will render your PCs stats in some areas negative or bizarrely high.
  * Changing stats like this is likely to confuse releveling mods. You may want to disable such mods before importing stats. It may be necessary to remove them (which may require some in-game preparation), then load the leveling mod, then resave, then re-add the mod in order to make the leveling mod adjust to your modified stats.
  * To tweak the stats of an existing character, try importing the character to a mod file, editing the character there and then importing the edited character to your game.
* __Notes__
  * **Race Import is incomplete.** Importing race will change the physical appearance and identification of your character, but **will not** change racial powers. E.g., you'll look like a Wood Elf, but have the powers of an Imperial.
  * If you want to **associate an image with a face,** then:
    * Save the image to <code>Data\Docs\Images\[EditorId].jpg</code>
    * Note that the file needs to be in jpeg format and be named so that it matches the editor id of the face.
    * Bash displays the face in a 350 by 210 pixel box. Your face does not have to be that size, but ideally it would have the same 5:3 width:height ratio. Bash will scale the face down as needed to fit in the box.

=== Import to Mod
* To import a face into a mod, select the mod, right click and select "Import Face".
* __Best Practice__
  * Start by creating an empty "PC Faces.esp" mod. You can easily do this by using the construction set, or you can copy "Blank.esp" from Mopy\Extras.
  * Use this single mod as your face "library". Import any interesting faces from saves, then use TESCS to further edit "PC Faces.esp".
* __Notes/Warnings__
  * It's strongly suggested that you import only to a mod that contains nothing but npcs.
  * Face Import does not check for unique editor ids. If this is a danger, edit the file in TESCS. TESCS will auto-rename any duplicated editor ids, but you'll probably want to rename manually (since DUPLICATE0000 is not so informative!)
* __Importing Non-standard Eyes/Hair__
  * Ordinarily, bash will only import eyes and hair that come from Oblivion.esm or the mod itself. However, it is possible to access eyes and hair from other mods with a little work.
  * First, convert the source cosmetic esp to an esm. (On the mods tab of Bash, use the "Copy to Esm" function.)
  * Now, open your face library esp in the construction set, but be sure to also load the new cosmetic esm. Then save (this will add the cosmetic esm to the master list of the face library esp).
  * Next, go to the save, right-click on the cosmetic esp in the list of masters on the right side of the window, select "Change to...", and then select the esm version. (Here, you're switching the dependency from the esp to the esm version.) Then save.
  * **Now** go back to the mods tab and import the face. The eyes/hair should now be imported.
  * ~~In short, Bash will only import eyes/hair if the eyes/hair come from an esm if the esp already has access (i.e., is dependent on) that esm.~~

== Screenshots Tab ============================================================
<img src="bash/images/WryeBash_06.png" width="686" height="493" style="border: 0;" alt="Screenshots Tab"></img>
This allows you to preview your screenshots.

=== Screenshots Commands
Right click on the column header to see these:
* __Open:__ View the screenshot directory in Windows Explorer.
* __Next Shot:__ Set the name/number of the next screenshot.
* __JPEG Quality:__ Set the JPEG quality used when converting to JPEG.

=== Screenshot Commands
Right click on a screenshot to see these:
* __Delete:__ Deletes selected files.
* __Convert:__ Converts selected files to one of the following formats: JPG, PNG, BMP, TIF
  * If file by name new name already exists, then conversion will be skipped (for that file).
* __Rename:__ Renames selected files according to format.
  * If multiple files are selected, they'll be numbered sequentially after the first.
  * If file by new name already exists, then rename for that file will be skipped.

== PM Archive Tab =============================================================
<img src="bash/images/WryeBash_08.png" width="687" height="500" style="border: 0;" alt="Screenshots Tab"></img>
Archive, view, search PM's from the official forum. **Note:** This is fairly new and a bit experimental at this time (11/6/2007). It should be fairly safe, but I suggest that you keep a backup of any messages that you enter into this.

=== Import Archives
* __What's Importable__
  * Only html format archives are archiveable. Excel format archives are ''not'' archiveable.
  * PMs from other forums that use the same software as the bethsoft forums ~~may~~ also be importable -- but this has not been tested yet.
* __Setup__
  * Typically you'll have your archives as attachments to mail messages. You'll need to save these to disk. When you save, it's best to name the file like "07.11.06 archive.html" or "2007.11.06 archive.html" (where the leading digits are year, month, date) -- **using the date the archive was created!**
    * It's important to get the archive date correct, since Bash will use it to figure out the date of PMs dated as "Today" or "Yesterday".
    * Note: The rest of the name doesn't matter -- it's just the date that counts.
  * It's usually simplest to save a bunch (all) of your archives to disk at once in a special folder.
* __Importing__
  * Once you've got the archives saved as files...
  * Go to "PM Archives" tab, right click on column header at the top of the window and select "Import Archives..." Use the dialog to select the archives that you want to import.

=== Searching PMs
* It's easy to search. Just enter the search term at the bottom and hit return (or press the Search button). Messages will be searched for the term in the subject, author and text fields, and the list will be filtered down to matching messages.
* To get back to the full list, either:
  * Clear the search field and hit enter. Or
  * Click the Clear button.

=== Other Notes
* You can delete any message or group of message by right clicking on them and selecting "Delete"
* You can sort by any of the columns. When sorting by subject, leading "Re: " will be ignored -- thus messages should group together correctly. Also when searching by Subject or Author columns, messages will first be sorted by date.
* If you select multiple messages at once, all of them will be shown in the view pane, in the same order as they are shown in the list.
* When you select messages, they're actually temporarily written to an html file. You can view this directly, mail it to people, etc. You'll find the temporary file at "My Games\Oblivion\Messages.html"

== People Tab =================================================================
<img src="bash/images/WryeBash_PeopleTab.png" width="834" height="600" style="border: 0;"  alt="tool image"></img>
The People tab is a simple database that you can use to keep reminders about various people on the forums. You may find it useful if you're on the forums and want to keep some reminders about various people. (E.g. why you blocked someone, or what awesome mod a person did.)

=== General
* As with other tabs, right click on individual items to see the item menu, or on the column header to see the header menu. Left clicking on a column will sort the list based on that column.
* Aside from the Name, column, the two other columns are:
  * Karma (from -5 to +5) to rate your disposition towards the person.
  * Header: the first 75 characters of the text.
* Text: Description of the person. You'll probably want to start with a brief summary (maybe using keywords), since that's what will show up in the header column.
* Icon: The icon for each person reflects their karma:
  * <img src="bash/images/checkbox_purple_inc.png" width="16" height="16" style="border: 0;"  alt="tool image"></img> +5: Purple
  * <img src="bash/images/checkbox_blue_inc.png" width="16" height="16" style="border: 0;"  alt="tool image"></img> +3,+4: Blue
  * <img src="bash/images/checkbox_green_inc.png" width="16" height="16" style="border: 0;"  alt="tool image"></img> +1,+2: Green
  * <img src="bash/images/checkbox_grey_off.png" width="16" height="16" style="border: 0;"  alt="tool image"></img> +0: Grey (Default)
  * <img src="bash/images/checkbox_yellow_off.png" width="16" height="16" style="border: 0;"  alt="tool image"></img> -1,-2: Yellow
  * <img src="bash/images/checkbox_orange_off.png" width="16" height="16" style="border: 0;"  alt="tool image"></img> -3,-4: Orange
  * <img src="bash/images/checkbox_red_off.png" width="16" height="16" style="border: 0;"  alt="tool image"></img> -5: Red

=== Add/Delete People
* You can add and delete records by clicking using the Add/Delete commands.
* Add is available from both the item menu and the header menu.
* Delete is available for selected records.

=== Import People
* Use the Import command on the header menu to import records from a text file.
* Import format is simple. To begin a new person record, start a line with <code>== PersonName</code>. That will define a new record. All text under that, up to the next PersonName header will become the text for that character.

=== Export People
* Use this command to export selected people to a text file.
* Note: Karma is not exported.

=== Karma
* Use this command to assign Karma to a person.

== Oblivion.esm Swapping ======================================================
~~Note that this features does not yet work with non-English versions of Oblivion! Nor does it work for pre-1.1 copies of Oblivion. It also requires some preparation __before__ installing Shivering Isles!~~

The release of the Shivering Isles (SI) expansion has complicated life for modders. The problem is that the expansion is placed not in a new esm or esp, but rather directly into the existing Oblivion.esm. (There is a DLCShiveringIsles.esp that comes with the expansion, but it is empty and apparently is only use to trigger SI bsa archive loading).

The problem with this approach is that:
* It forces players to use the new material, which may be a problem on lower performance machines.
* It forces modders to build on top of Shivering Isles data, which in turn requires version 1.2 of the TESCS, which results in mods that will only run on 1.2 patched systems, and which in turn are not modifiable by players who ~~haven't~~ upgraded to 1.2.

Perhaps these problems are not that horrendous, but it would be nice to be able to quickly switch between the different versions of the Oblivion.esm. Bash allows you to do this.

=== Swapping Setup
* **The major point is that for swapping to work, you must have copies of both the 1.1 and the SI versions of Oblivion.esm available. This is only possible if you copy Oblivion.esm before installing Shivering Isles.**
* If you have ~~not~~ done that, then you'll need to:
  * Reinstall Oblivion
  * Update it using the Oblivion 1.1 patch
  * Copy Oblivion.esm to one of the following:
    * if 247388848 bytes to 'Oblivion_1.1.esm' (most common)
    * or if 247388812 bytes to 'Oblivion_GOTY non-SI.esm' (GOTY version)
    * or if 247388894 bytes to 'Oblivion_1.1b.esm' (an uncommon variant)
  * Reinstall Shivering Isles.
* If you have not yet installed Shivering Isles, then great! All you have to do is the last two steps above.

=== Version Indicators
Bash now indicates the current version of Oblivion.esm in several places...
* Mods tab: You'll see either [1.1] or [GOTY non-SI] or [SI] after Oblivion.esm listing.
* Masters tab: For both mods and savegames, you'll again see [1.1] or [GOTY non-SI] or [SI] appended to Oblivion.esm. Note that this **does not** indicate the version used when the mod was built or the savegame was saved. Rather it just indicates the version of the currently loaded Oblivion.esm.
* The title of the main Bash window. You'll see either [1.1] or [GOTY non-SI] or [SI] at the end of the title.

=== Mod Tab Swapping
* Two swap versions on the mod tab, right click anywhere on the column header and got to the Oblivion.esm __menu item__. The currently available and selected versions will pop up in a submenu where you can select them.
* Selecting a different version will swap names around -- you should see the change reflected immediately in the [[#|Version Indicators]].

=== Save Tab Swapping
* The same command is available from the column header context menu of the Saves Tab, and does exactly the same thing, but with ~~one exception...~~
* When you make the selection from the saves tab, it will not only swap Oblivion.esm, but it will also mark the selected version as the preferred version to use with the current [[#SaveProfiles|save profile]]. If you later switch from another profile back to this one, the Oblivion.esm version will be swapped automatically.
* **Tip:** If you're already using save profiles, then visit all of your existing save profiles and use the Oblivion.esm command to set the default for each of them.

== Extending ==================================================================
=== Internationalization
Bash now supports localization for most? western languages (translation of program strings to local language). It still probably does not support non-roman character sets (Cyrillic, Arabic, Asian languages, etc.). Since you're looking here, I'm assuming that you're trying to add translations for your language. Here's how:
* **Custom Program Strings**
  * Custom program strings are translated from lookup files that you'll find in the <code>Mopy\Data</code>. E.g., for English, it would be <code>Mopy\Data\English.pkl</code>. (Of course, the program is already in English, so this isn't needed.)
  * These pkl files are automatically compiled from the corresponding txt files (e.g., <code>Mopy\Data\English.txt</code>) as needed when Bash (or bish) starts up. So, to update the program strings for your language all you have to do is edit the txt file in a text editor, adding translations for strings. Naturally, not everyone needs to do this -- once someone does the txt files for a language, they can redistribute them to other people -- including me, so that I can include them in next Bash release.
* **Generating the Translation**
. To begin translating, or update an existing translation file...
  * Go to Mods tab, right click on **File** column header and select **Dump Translator** from the popup menu.
  * This will generate a new version of the translator file for your locale. It will be named appropriately (except for the leading "NEW") and will contain any translations that have already been done.
  * Delete the old translator text file, and rename the new one to replace it.
  * Edit the new translator file, adding translations to replace any that are missing or incorrect.
* **Translation Tips**
  * Here's part of the a translator file:
<pre>
=== basher.py, 3711
Active profile cannot be removed.
>>>>

=== basher.py, 3717
Delete profile %s and the %d save files it contains?
>>>>
DELETE PROFILE %s AND THE %d SAVE FILES IT CONTAINS?

</pre>
  * Each entry begins with the source file and the line number (in case this helps you figure out how to translate the code).
  * After that is the original text, then a <code>>>>></code> dividing line, then the translated text. Here, the second entry has been translated, while the first has not. (Here the "translation" consists of changing it to upper case.
  * It's important that you leave the formatting characters in place and in order! Formatting characters are text like <code> %s %d %08X \n</code>. The '%' strings are place holders where file names, counts, etc. are entered -- if they're not present, Bash will throw an exception. The \n combinations are newline characters -- I use them in dialogs and other places where I want line breaks.
  * In translating, I would suggest that you translate the strings that you see the most first. E.g., a good one for a quick test is <code>basher.py, 1916: Mods</code> -- this is the name of the Mods tab. And right under it is the name of the Saves tab.
  * To test your translations, just save your changes to the text file, and restart Bash. Your changes should appear immediately.
  * Of course, it's probably a good idea to keep backup copies of your translator file in case you mess one up. If you revert to a backup copy, just throw the pkl version away for it to update. (Remember it won't autocompile unless the text file is newer than the pkl file.)
  * Spell checking: If you're using an office suite, you might want to turn on dictionaries for both English and your language -- Abot mentions that Open Office allows you to do this.

    * New functions:
      * [[wizards.html#GetEspmStatus|[color=purple]GetEspmStatus[/color]]]: Find the status of an installed mod (Missing, Inactive, Imported, Active, Merged)

      * [[wizards.html#Exec|[color=purple]Exec[/color]]]: Execute wizard lines stored in a string.  Useful for dynamically creating menus.
      * [[wizards.html#endswith|[color=purple]endswith[/color]]]: Test what a string ends with.
      * [[wizards.html#startswith|[color=purple]startswith[/color]]]: Test what a string starts with.

      * [[wizards.html#GetFolder|[color=purple]GetFolder[/color]]]: For getting a folder name from a path string.
    * Improved [[wizards.html#ForContinueBreakEndFor|[color=blue]For[/color]]] loops, for iterating over files in an installer:
