<h1><a id='Introduction'>Introduction</a></h1>
<p>This document explains what all the bashed patch options mean and gives some guidence on when to select them.  Please note, when I say that it should be checked, that only applies if there are items on the right side as well (except for one patch option which is detailed below).  Also, when I say mods, I mean just that, mods.  Don't check any of the csv files unless you know that they're what you want.
</p>
<p class="empty">&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a id='AliasModNames'>Alias Mod Names</a></h2>
<p class="list-1">&bull;&nbsp;  Should you check it? Not normally.</p>
<p class="list-1">&bull;&nbsp;  What does it do? If a mod has been renamed, it allows patch options that use the original mod name to know that it needs to use the new mod name instead.</p>
<p class="list-1">&bull;&nbsp;  When does the user need it? If for instance, you rename Oscuros_Oblivion_Overhaul.esp to OOO.esp (for whatever reason), you'll need this option so that Bash knows that OOO.esp is really Oscuros_Oblivion_Overhaul.esp.</p>
<p class="empty">&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a id='MergePatches'>Merge Patches</a></h2>
<p class="list-1">&bull;&nbsp;  Should you check it? Yes. Unless you need it, it won't help you, but it also doesn't hurt to have it active.</p>
<p class="list-1">&bull;&nbsp;  What does it do? It copies mods into the Bashed Patch so that they don't have to be active.</p>
<p class="list-1">&bull;&nbsp;  When does the user need it? If you're running out of space in your load order (Oblivion can only handle 254 mods at a time) this can merge some mods into the Bashed Patch so that you have more space. Some mods have to be merged to work properly (filter mods, Item Interchange), but this should be noted in the mod's readme.</p>
<p class="list-1">&bull;&nbsp;  When does a modder need it? If you're creating a filter or item interchange type mod. See the readme for details.</p>
<p class="empty">&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a id='ReplaceFormIDs'>Replace Form IDs</a></h2>
<p class="list-1">&bull;&nbsp;  Should you check it? No. This is an advanced option. If you need it, you'll know it (or be instructed to use it).</p>
<p class="list-1">&bull;&nbsp;  What does it do? It replaces a set of formIDs with another set of formIDs defined by a csv file.</p>
<p class="list-1">&bull;&nbsp;  When does the user need it? If you want to replace all usage of one item for another. For instance, P1DCandles replaces all static, non-movable candles with candles that can be picked up, moved around, stolen, etc. It only works for Oblivion.esm though. This option allows P1DCandles to work for all mods (assuming you have the original mod installed).</p>
<p class="list-1">&bull;&nbsp;  When does a modder need it? If you're systematically replacing a formID with another, this will do the work for you. It also works across all mods the user has.</p>
<p class="empty">&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a id='ImportActors'>Import Actors</a></h2>
<p class="list-1">&bull;&nbsp;  Should you check it? Yes. All mods should probably be checked unless you are told otherwise.</p>
<p class="list-1">&bull;&nbsp;  What does it do? Some mods make changes to NPCs and Creatures and want those changes to be preserved even if another mod changes the same NPC / Creature. This ensures that those changes are kept.</p>
<p class="list-1">&bull;&nbsp;  When does the user need it? Normally always. Advanced users may prefer to keep changes from one mod and not the other.</p>
<p class="list-1">&bull;&nbsp;  When does a modder need it? If you make changes to one of the following and it is important that the change is kept:</p>
  <p class="list-2">&bull;&nbsp;  Actor aggression, confidence, energy level, responsibility, services, training skill, or training level you need to tag the mod with 'Actors.AIData'.</p>

<h2><a id='ImportActorsAIPackages'>Import Actors: AIPackages</a></h2>
<p class="list-1">&bull;&nbsp;  Should you check it? Yes. All mods should probably be checked unless you are told otherwise.</p>
<p class="list-1">&bull;&nbsp;  What does it do? Some mods make changes to NPCs and Creatures AI Packages and want those changes to be preserved even if another mod changes the same NPC / Creature. This merges the AI Packages so that they are all present from all tagged mods.</p>
<p class="list-1">&bull;&nbsp;  When does the user need it? Normally always. Advanced users may prefer to keep changes from one mod and not the other.</p>
<p class="list-1">&bull;&nbsp;  When does a modder need it? If you make changes to one of the following and it is important that the change is kept:</p>
  <p class="list-2">&bull;&nbsp;  Actor AI Packages you need to tag the mod with 'Actors.AIPackages'. If you're re-adding an AI Package that was previously removed, you need to tag the mod with 'Actors.AIPackagesForceAdd' as well.</p>

Some mods make changes to NPCs and Creatures death items (items that are added to the NPC / Creature only when it dies) and want those changes to be preserved even if another mod changes the same NPC / Creature. This ensures that those changes are kept.</p>
<p class="list-1">&bull;&nbsp;  When does the user need it? Normally always. Advanced users may prefer to keep changes from one mod and not the other.</p>
<p class="list-1">&bull;&nbsp;  When does a modder need it? If you make changes to one of the following and it is important that the change is kept:</p>
  <p class="list-2">&bull;&nbsp;  Actor Death Items you need to tag the mod with 'Actors.DeathItem'.</p>
